'''Carthage National Museum''', along with the [[Bardo National Museum]] one of the two main archaeological museums in [[Tunisia]], is a [[national museum]] displaying archaeological items; it is sited at the hill of Byrsa in the heart of the city of [[Carthage]]. Founded in 1875, it is one of the country's most extensive museums.

Located near the Cathedral of Saint-Louis of Carthage, it allows the visitor to appreciate the magnitude of the city during the [[Punic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] eras. Some of the best pieces found in excavations are limestone/marble carvings, depicting animals, plants and even human sculptures. Of special note is a marble [[sarcophagus]] of a priest and priestess from the 3rd century BC, discovered in the [[necropolis]] of Carthage. The Museum also has a noted collection of masks and jewelry in cast glass, Roman mosaics including the famous &quot;Lady of Carthage&quot;, a vast collection of Roman [[amphora]]s. It also contains numerous local items from the period of the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Also on display are objects of [[ivory]].

== History of the museum==

[[File:Cour MNC.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior]]
[[Image:Mus?e Lavigerie.jpg|thumb|right|Punic items]]
[[File:Salle Byrsa MNC 1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Interior]]
The museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal [[Charles Martial Lavigerie]] in the premises of the [[monastery]]; its name until 1956 was the '''Museum Lavigerie'''.

The museum is the product of excavations conducted by European archaeologists, in particular those made by [[Alfred Louis Delattre]]. The Annex was used at first to house the items found in searches in the necropolis of Carthage and excavations of the St. Louis hill but also Douim?s, the hill of Juno, the Sainte-Monique Hill and also the Carthaginian Christian [[basilicas]]. However, many object unearthed were sold to tourists when the museum had a number of examples of similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;Azedine Beschaouch,''The Legend of Carthage'', ed. Gallimard, Paris, 1993: 44&lt;/ref&gt;.

The museum received its present name in 1956 and opened for the first time as a national museum in 1963. It has undergone extensive restructuring in the 1990s, and has now been redesigned to accommodate new discoveries on the site of Carthage, especially the product of searches conducted as part of the international campaign of the [[UNESCO]], from 1972-1995.

== Punic collections==
=== Phoenician===
[[Image:C?ramiques MNC-edit.png|left|thumb|Punic ceramic discoveries, note the number of oil lamps unearthed.]]
The various excavations at the site have uncovered numerous items characterizing the Phoenician civilization. The museum contains items which reveal a distinct connection with the [[Levant]] steeped in Egyptian and in particular Greek culture, and the ties of Carthage with [[Sicily]] during the [[Hellenistic]] period.  Testimonies to these connections are many objects of [[pottery]], oil lamps and [[amulet]] s discovered in excavating the necropolis.

The museum has a fine collection of Punic ceramics found from the late 19th century. A number of lamps were found during the excavation of pottery kilns dating back to the [[Third Punic War]] &lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipinski [eds.],''Dictionary of the Phoenician and Punic civilization'', ed. Brepols, Paris, 1992 254&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[amulet]]s of Egyptian gods ([[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], and [[Bes|B?s]]) indicates the importance of links between the Phoenicians and the [[Ancient Egypt]], the first retaining these cultural elements once they arrived in the Western Mediterranean.\

=== Funeral objects===
Beautiful [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] dating to the end of the Punic era, have been found in the [[necropolis]], notably the sarcophagus of the priest and the priestess, which is on display in the museum. The priest has the right hand raised in a gesture of [[blessing]] &lt;ref&gt;Andr? Parrot, Maurice H. Ch?hab and Sabatino Moscati, ''Les Ph?niciens'', ?d. Gallimard, coll. L?univers des formes, Paris, 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The left hands of the two figures carry  vases containing [[incense]] for [[Liturgy|liturgical purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim et Nicolas Fauqu?, ''La Tunisie antique. De Hannibal ? saint Augustin'', ?d. Meng?s, Paris, 2001, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Rasoirs puniques MN carthage.jpg|left|thumb|Ornate bronze Punic razors]]

Masks of glass also represent numerous deities, including objects which were intended to protect the deceased against the [[evil eye]]. There are also various items including [[razor]]s made of bronze and richly decorated with cast patterns, illustrating Egyptian and Greek influences  &lt;ref&gt;H?di Dridi, ''Carthage et le monde punique'', ?d. Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 2006, pp. 221-222&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of Punic amulets are also on display.
[[Image:Masque baal MN Carthage-retouche.png|right|thumb|upright|Br?le-parfum en forme de t?te de Ba?al]]

===Punic religion===
The terracotta perfume-burner in the form of the head of [[Ba'al Hammon]] was discovered in a sanctuary in the  Salammb? quarter unearthed by Dr [[Louis Carton]] shortly after World War I.; at the same time diverse other cultural objects came to light, including representations of [[Demeter]]&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim and Nicolas Fauqu?, ''op. cit.'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Les st?les du [[Tophet de Carthage|tophet]] constituent quant ? elles la collection la plus importante qui soit disponible. Bien que des st?les furent signal?es d?s les premi?res recherches sur le site de Carthage, en particulier lors des fouilles de Pricot de Sainte Marie (1874), dont la plupart coul?rent avec le ''[[Magenta (cuirass?)|Magenta]]'' en 1875, de nombreuses pi?ces parmi les plus int?ressantes sont d?pos?es au mus?e apr?s la d?couverte du sanctuaire en 1921. Outre les st?les plus communes en [[Gr?s (g?ologie)|gr?s]] d?[[El Haouaria]], les st?les de calcaire plus tardives font l?objet le plus souvent de d?cors vari?s : navires, palmiers, ?l?phants voire ?l?ments de portraits ? forte influence hell?nistique. Parfois, une inscription est pr?sente sur la st?le.
[[Image:St?le navire MN carthage.jpg|left|thumb|upright|St?le calcaire orn?e d?un navire et provenant du tophet]]
Des masques en forme de t?te de [[Ba'al Hammon]] sont ?galement expos?s, en particulier un grand masque d?couvert par le docteur Louis Carton au d?but du 20th century.

Le contenu de la ? chapelle Cintas ?, d?couverte au [[Tophet de Carthage|tophet]] par [[Pierre Cintas]] en 1947, fait l?objet d?une vitrine propre. Deux d?p?ts de foundation contenant surtout des c?ramiques y furent d?couverts, l?un situ? ? la base d?un mur et l?autre d?nomm?e ? cachette ? se trouvait sous le sol d?une petite pi?ce vo?t?e&lt;ref&gt;Fethi Chelbi, ? La chapelle Cintas ?, ''La M?diterran?e des Ph?niciens. De Tyr ? Carthage'', ?d. Somogy, Paris, 2007, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Punic architecture ===

[[Image:Fragments colonnes MN Carthage.jpg|right|thumb|Punic pillars]]

There are some architectural elements of the Punic city on display, especially fragments of columns and pillars and structures.

Also outlined is a Phoenician inscription on black marble called &quot;registration ?dilitaire&quot;, found in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;M?hamed Hassine Fantar, ? Architecture punique en Tunisie ?, ''La Tunisie, carrefour du monde antique'', ?d. Faton, Paris, 1995, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Roman collections ==
=== Evidence of the 146 battle: The remains of the siege ===

[[Image:Vitrine 3e guerre punique.jpg|right|thumb|Artefacts from the siege of 149-146]]

The history of the Roman city of Carthage begins with a disaster, the will to destroy a rival dating from 146, which has some moving testimonies from the period on showcase. Common items on display are [[bullet]]s, [[sword]]s and stone [[catapult]]s. A skeleton of one of fighters who died violently, is also exposed.

=== Roman art===

[[Image:Bas-relief 2 MN Carthage.jpg|left|thumb|Bas-relief of a woman]]
[[Image:Statue imp?riale 2, MNC.jpg|right|thumb|Roman bust]]
Elements of the official Roman art were discovered on the Byrsa hill, including sculptures and [[relief|bas reliefs]] depicting victory. These excavated items have been interpreted as a commemoration of the victory over the [[Parthians]] in 166, during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and presented on a triumphal arch or monument portal.&lt;ref&gt;Colette Picard, ''Carthage'', ?d. Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1951, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert-Charles Picard , ''L?art romain'', ?d. Presses universitaires de France, Paris, 1962, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, works from the reign of [[Augustus]] are presented including numerous busts. A remarkable representation of [[Auriga (slave)|Auriga]], holding a whip and a jug, a symbol of victory, is also exposed. This recent discovery is a valuable testimony to the attention of the Roman circus in the city, which was the second in size after the [[Circus Maximus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Azedine Beschaouch, ''op. cit.'', pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Mosaics ===
Although the collections of [[mosaic]]s of the museum are not comparable to those of [[Bardo National Museum]], the fact remains that genuine masterpieces are found in the museum. Among the recent discoveries, are from the panels found in a private spa located in Sidi Ghrib, near [[Tunis]]. It represents a topless woman running through a rose garden surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim et Nicolas Fauqu?, ''op. cit.'', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;.On the same site a panel of marble and limestone was discovered showing the activity of a matron at the end of the bath. It shows the individual seated on the toilet, surrounded by two servants, one of which holds a mirror and the other carrying a basket with various jewels. At the ends of the mosaic, the artist presents the bath accessories: a pair of sandals, a basket of laundry, a jug, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, ''Splendeurs des mosa?ques de Tunisie'', ?d. Agence nationale du patrimoine, Tunis, 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Christian and Byzantine Collections==
=== Testimonies of Ancient Christianity===

[[Image:Mosa?que chr?tienne MN Carthage.jpg|right|thumb|Mosa?que des quatre ?vang?listes d?couverte au ''vicus castrorum'']]

The mosaic of the four evangelists discovered in Carthage represents each of the four evangelists. In the center is a sphere in which integrates a [[crucifix|cross]]. This work symbolizes the triumph of [[Christianity]] and its distribution to the four cardinal points by [[Liliane Ennabli]] &lt;ref&gt;Liliane Ennabli, ''Carthage, une m?tropole chr?tienne, ?d. CNRS, Paris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;.

Features of African Christianity at the time, such as ceramic tiles decorated with religious motifs were also excavated and are on display. Many of them are relatively large with decorative details which were intended to depict of the themes of the [[Old Testament]] including [[Daniel and the Lion's Den]].

A large number of funerary inscriptions discovered by [[Alfred Louis Delattre]] are displayed in the Carthage museum, found during his excavation of the main basilica.

===Byzantine Civilisation ===

[[Image:Dame Carthage(MNC).jpg|right|thumb|The famous ''Lady of Carthage'' mosaic]]
[[Image:Carreaux c?ramique chr?tienne mnc.JPG|thumb|left|Carreaux de c?ramique ? motifs chr?tiens]]

The famous &quot;Lady of Carthage&quot; mosaic dated back probably to the 6th century, is traditionally regarded as a portrait of a Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, ''op. cit.'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of alternating mosaic tiles and glass tiles, the fineness of the design and elegance of the subject makea it a major piece of art mosaic from the Late Antiquity.

'''Himera''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|?????}}), was an important [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Sicily]], situated on the north coast of the island, at the mouth of the river of the same name (the modern [[Grande River (Sicily)|Grande]]), between Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) and Cephaloedium (modern [[Cefal?]]). Its remains lie within the borders of the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Termini Imerese]].

==History==
===Foundation and earliest history===
It was the first Greek settlement on this part of the island and was a strategic outpost just outside the eastern boundary of the [[Carthaginian]]-controlled west. [[Thucydides]] says it was the only Greek city on this coast of Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;vi. 62, vii. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; which must however be understood with reference only to independent cities; [[Mylae]], which was also on the north coast, and certainly of Greek origin, being a dependency of [[Zancle]] (modern [[Messina]]). All authorities agree that Himera was a colony of Zancle, but Thucydides tells us that, with the emigrants from Zancle, who were of Chalcidic origin, were mingled a number of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] exiles, the consequence of which was, that, though the institutions ({{polytonic|??????}}) of the new city were Chalcidic, its dialect had a mixture of [[Doric Greek|Doric]].

The foundation of Himera is placed subsequent to that of Mylae (as, from their relative positions, might naturally have been expected) both by [[Strabo]] and [[Scymnus|Scymnus Chius]]: its date is not mentioned by Thucydides, but [[Diodorus]] tells us that it had existed 240 years at the time of its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would fix its first settlement in [[648 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 5; Strab. vi. p. 272; Scymn. Ch. 289; Diod. xiii. 62; Hecat. ''fr.'' 49; Scyl. p. 4. ? 13.&lt;/ref&gt; We have very little information as to its early history: an obscure notice in [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhet. ii. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; from which it appears to have at one time fallen under the dominion of the tyrant [[Phalaris]], being the only mention we find of it, until about [[490 BCE]], when it afforded a temporary refuge to [[Scythes]], tyrant of Zancle, after his expulsion from the latter city.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. vi. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after this event, Himera fell itself under the yoke of a despot named [[Terillus]], who sought to fortify his power by contracting a close alliance with [[Anaxilas]], at that time ruler both of Rhegium (modern [[Reggio di Calabria]]) and Zancle. But Terillus was unable to resist the power of [[Theron of Acragas|Theron]], despot of Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]), and, being expelled by him from Himera, had recourse to the assistance of the Carthaginians, a circumstance which became the immediate occasion of the first great expedition of that people to Sicily, [[480 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' vii. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First interaction with Carthage===
The magnitude of the armament sent under [[Hamilcar]], who is said to have landed in Sicily with an army of 300,000 men, in itself sufficiently proves that the conquest of Himera was rather the pretext, than the object, of the war: but it is likely that the growing power of that city, in the immediate neighborhood of the Carthaginian settlements of Panormus and [[Solus]], had already given umbrage to the latter people. Hence it was against Himera that the first efforts of Hamilcar were directed: but Theron, who had thrown himself into the city with all the forces at his command, was able to maintain its defence till the arrival of [[Gelon of Syracuse]], who, notwithstanding the numerical inferiority of his forces, defeated the vast army of the Carthaginians with such slaughter that the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)]] was regarded by the Greeks of Sicily as worthy of comparison with the contemporary victory of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herod. vii. 166, 167; Diod. xi. 20-23; Pind. ''Pyth.'' i. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The same feeling probably gave rise to the tradition or belief, that both triumphs were achieved on the very same day.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Battle of Himera===
This great victory left Theron in the undisputed possession of the sovereignty of Himera, as well as of that of Agrigentum; but he appears to have bestowed his principal attention upon the latter city, and consigned the government of Himera to his son [[Thrasydaeus]]. But the young man, by his violent and oppressive rule, soon alienated the minds of the citizens, who in consequence applied for relief to [[Hieron of Syracuse]], at that time on terms of hostility with Theron. The Syracusan despot, however, instead of lending assistance to the discontented party at Himera, betrayed their overtures to Theron, who took signal vengeance on the unfortunate Himeraeans, putting to death a large number of the disaffected citizens, and driving others into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xi. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, seeing that the city had suffered greatly from these severities, and that its population was much diminished, he sought to restore its prosperity by establishing there a new body of citizens, whom he collected from various quarters. The greater part of these new colonists were of [[Dorians|Dorian]] extraction; and though the two bodies of citizens were blended into one, and continued to live harmoniously together, we find that from this period Himera became a Doric city, and both adopted the institutions, and followed the policy, of the other Doric states of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement seems to have taken place in [[476 BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;There is a confusion about this date; for, though Diodorus relates the circumstances in the year of Phaedon, Ol. LXXVI. 1, which would place it in [[476 BCE]], he adds that the new colony subsisted 58 years, till its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would refer it to the year [[466 BCE]]. This last date is clearly incompatible with the fact that Theron died in [[472 BCE]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Himera continued subject to Theron till his death, in [[472 BCE]]: but Thrasydaeus retained possession of the sovereignty for a very short time after the death of his father, and his defeat by Hieron of Syracuse was speedily followed by his expulsion both from Agrigentum and Himera.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[466 BCE]] we find the Himeraeans, in their turn, sending a force to assist the Syracusans in throwing off the yoke of [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]]; and, in the general settlement of affairs which followed soon after, the exiles were allowed to return to Himera, where they appear to have settled quietly together with the new citizens. &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 68, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period Diodorus expressly tells us that Himera was fortunate enough to escape from civil dissensions,&lt;ref&gt;xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and this good government must have secured to it no small share of the prosperity which was enjoyed by the Sicilian cities in general during the succeeding half-century.

But though we are told in general terms that the period which elapsed from this re-settlement of Himera till its destruction by the Carthaginians ([[461 BCE|461]]&amp;ndash;[[408 BCE]]), was one of peace and prosperity, the only notices we find of the city during this interval refer to the part it took at the time of the [[ancient Athens|Athenian]] expedition to Sicily, [[415 BCE]]. On that occasion, the Himeraeans were among the first to promise their support to Syracuse: hence, when [[Nicias]] presented himself before their port with the Athenian fleet, they altogether refused to receive him; and, shortly after, it was at Himera that [[Gylippus]] landed, and from whence he marched across the island to Syracuse, at the head of a force composed in great part of Himeraean citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] vi. 62, vii. 1, 58; Diod. xiii. 4, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction by Carthage===
[[File:Him409.PNG|thumb|300px]]
A few years after this the prosperity of the city was brought to a sudden and abrupt termination by the [[Battle of Himera (409 BC)|great Carthaginian expedition to Sicily]]. Though the ostensible object of that armament, as it had been of the Athenian, was the support of the [[Segesta]]ns against their neighbors, the [[Selinunte|Selinuntines]], yet there can be no doubt that the Carthaginians, from the first, entertained more extensive designs; and, immediately after the destruction of Selinus, [[Hannibal Mago]], who commanded the expedition, hastened to turn his arms against Himera. That city was ill-prepared for defence; its fortifications were of little strength, but the citizens made a desperate resistance, and by a vigorous sally inflicted severe loss on the Carthaginians. They were at first supported by a force of about 4000 auxiliaries from Syracuse, under the command of [[Diocles of Syracuse|Diocles]]; but that general became seized with a panic fear for the safety of Syracuse itself, and precipitately abandoned Himera, leaving the unfortunate citizens to contend singlehanded against the Carthaginian power. The result could not be doubtful, and the city was soon taken by storm: a large part of the citizens were put to the sword, and not less than 3000 of them, who had been taken prisoners, were put to death in cold blood by Hannibal, as a sacrifice to the memory of his grandfather Hamilcar.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiii. 59-62; Xen. ''Hell.'' i. 1. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The city itself was utterly destroyed, its buildings razed to the ground, and even the temples themselves were not spared; the Carthaginian general being evidently desirous to obliterate all trace of a city whose name was associated with the great defeat of his countrymen.

[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], who relates the total destruction of Himera, tells us expressly that it was never rebuilt, and that the site remained uninhabited down to his own times.&lt;ref&gt;xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems at first in contradiction with this statement, that he elsewhere includes the Himeraeans, as well as the Selinuntines and Agrigentines, among the exiled citizens that were allowed by the treaty, concluded with Carthage, in [[405 BCE]], to return to their homes, and inhabit their own cities, on condition of paying tribute to Carthage and not restoring their fortifications. &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiii. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; And it seems clear that many of them at least availed themselves of this permission, as we find the Himeraeans subsequently mentioned among the states that declared in favour of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]], at the commencement of his great war with Carthage in [[397 BCE]]; though they quickly returned to the Carthaginian alliance in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiv. 47, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation of this difficulty is furnished by [[Cicero]], who tells us that, after the destruction of Himera, those citizens who had survived the calamity of the war established themselves at [[Termini Imerese|Thermae]], within the confines of the same territory, and not far from their old town.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''''[[In Verrem]]'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus gives a somewhat different account of the foundation of Thermae, which he represents as established by the Carthaginians themselves before the close of the war, in [[407 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiii. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is probable that both statements are substantially correct, and that the Carthaginians founded the new town in the immediate neighbourhood of Himera, in order to prevent the old site being again occupied; while the Himeraean exiles, when they returned thither, though they settled in the new town, naturally regarded themselves as still the same people, and would continue to bear the name of Himeraeans. How completely, even at a much later period, the one city was regarded as the representative of the other, appears from the statement of Cicero, that when [[Scipio Africanus]], after the capture of Carthage, restored to the Agrigentines and Gelenses the statues that had been carried off from their respective cities, he at the same time restored to the citizens of Thermae those that had been taken from Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5, iv. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence we cannot be surprised to find that, not only are the Himeraeans still spoken of as an existing people, but even that the name of Himera itself is sometimes inadvertently used as that of their city. Thus, in [[314 BCE]], Diodorus tells us that, by the treaty between [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] and the Carthaginians, it was stipulated that [[Heraclea Minoa|Heracleia]], [[Selinunte|Selinus]] and [[Himera]] should continue subject to Carthage as they had been before. &lt;ref&gt;Diod. xix. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more strange that we find the name of Himera reappear both in [[Mela]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], though we know from the distinct statements of Cicero and Strabo, as well as Diodorus, that it had ceased to exist centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Mel. ii. 7. ? 16; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of Thermae===
{{main|Termini Imerese}}
The new town of Thermae or Therma called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{polytonic|?????? ?? ???????}}, Pol.; {{polytonic|?????? ??????}}, Ptol.; {{polytonic|?????}}, {{polytonic|????? ???????}}, Diod.&lt;/ref&gt; which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; [[Pindar]] ''Ol.'' xii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the [[First Punic War]] its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in [[260 BCE]], a body of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by [[Hamilcar]], and defeated with heavy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero relates that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity. &lt;ref&gt;''quod semper in amicitia fideque mansissent'', Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' ii: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; They were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, so it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as ''oppidum non maximum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ii. 46, 75, iii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have received a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] in the time of [[Augustus]], whence we find mention in inscriptions of the ''Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum'': &lt;ref&gt;Castell. ''Inscr. Sicil.'' p. 47; Gruter. ''Inscr.'' p. 433, no. 6..&lt;/ref&gt; and there can be little doubt that the Thermae colonia of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern [[Sciacca]]), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum and Selinus. &lt;ref&gt;Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in [[Ptolemy]] and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]], and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of [[Termini Imerese]] retains the ancient site as well as name.&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. iii. 4. ? 4; ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'' p. 92; ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it ''in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum''; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage; and which were valuable, not only as relics of the past, but from their high merit as works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous examples of coins from Himera testify to the city's wealth in antiquity.

==Current situation==
Because of extensive remains, no doubt can therefore exist with regard to the site of Thermae, which would be, indeed, sufficiently marked by the hot springs themselves; but the exact position of the more ancient city of Himera was a subject of controversy until recent times. The opinion of [[Cluverius]], which has been followed by almost all subsequent writers into the 19th century, would place it on the left bank of the river which flows by Termini on the west, and is thence commonly known as the Fiume di Termini, though called in the upper part of its course Fiume San Leonardo. On this supposition the inhabitants merely removed from one bank of the river to the other; and this would readily explain the passages in which Himera and Thermae appear to be regarded as identical, and where the river Himera (which unquestionably gave name to the older city) is represented at the same time as flowing by Thermae.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 232; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Vib. ''Sequest.'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is great difficulty in supposing that the Fiume San Leonardo can be the river Himera; and all our data with regard to the latter would seem to support which the view of [[Fazello]], who identifies it with the [[Fiume Grande]], the mouth of which is distant just 8 miles from Termini. This is the view adopted by most modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Barrington|47 &amp; notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distance can hardly be said to be too great to be reconciled with Cicero's expression, that the new settlement was established ''non longe ab oppido antique'';&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; while the addition that it was in the same territory &lt;ref&gt;''in ejusdem agri finibus'', ''l. c.''.&lt;/ref&gt; would seem to imply that it was not very near the old site. It may be added, that, in this case, the new site would have had the recommendation in the eyes of the Carthaginians of being nearer to their own settlements of Solus and Panormus, and, consequently, more within their command. But Fazello's view derives a strong confirmation from the circumstance, stated by him, that the site which he indicates, marked by the Torre di Bonfornello on the seacoast (on the left bank of the Fiume Grande, close to its mouth), though presenting no ruins, abounded in ancient relics, such as vases and bronzes; and numerous sepulchres had also been brought to light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Fazello]] ix. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, neither Cluverius nor any other writer has noticed the existence of any ancient remains on the west bank of the Himera; nor does it appear that the site so fixed is one adapted for a city of importance.

==Archaeology==
The only recognizable ruin in this city is the Tempio della Vittoria (Temple of Victory), a [[Doric order|Doric]] structure supposedly built to commemorate the defeat of the Carthaginians (although recently some scholars have come to doubt this hypothesis).  To the south of the temple was the town's [[necropolis]].  Some artifacts recovered from this site are kept in a small [[antiquarium]].  However, the more impressive displays are in [[Palermo]]'s Museo Archeologico Regionale.

==Famous people==
Himera was celebrated in antiquity as the birth place of the poet [[Stesichorus]], who appears, from an anecdote preserved by [[Aristotle]], to have taken considerable part in the political affairs of his native city. His statue was still preserved at Thermae in the days of Cicero, and regarded with the utmost veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Rhet.'' ii. 20; Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5; [[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 232; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii. 19. ? 13.; ''[[Suda]]'', under {{polytonic|??????????}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ergoteles]], whose victory at the [[Olympic games]] is celebrated by [[Pindar]], was a citizen, but not a native, of Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Pind. ''Ol.'' xii.; Paus. vi. 4. ? 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Thermae had the honour of being the birthplace of the tyrant [[Agathocles]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diod. xix. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Carthage''' (from  [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''{{lang|phn-Latn|Qart-?ad?at}}''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.ca/books?ei=hKY7Tb2bAdL2gAfPn7HCCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=lrIiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=carthage+%22hadsat%22&amp;q=+%22hadsat%22#search_anchor Annales]'', 1908. p.253.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Semitic]] [[civilization]] centered on the [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]] of [[Carthage]], located in [[North Africa]] on the [[Gulf of Tunis]], outside what is now [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]]. It was founded in 814 BC. Originally a dependency of the Phoenician state of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Carthage gained independence around 650 BC and established a [[hegemony]] over other Phoenician settlements throughout the [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]] and what is now [[Spain]] which lasted until 146 BC. At the height of the city's prominence, its influence extended over most of the western [[Mediterranean]].

Carthage was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. They also had to deal with the volatile [[Berber people|Berbers]], the indigenous inhabitants of the entire area where Carthage was built. After the [[Third Punic War|third and final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed and then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the other Phoenician city-states and former Carthaginian dependencies fell into Roman hands from then on.

==Extent of Phoenician settlement==
In order to provide safe harbors for their merchant fleets, or to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resources, or to conduct trade free of outside interference, the Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean. They were also stimulated to found these cities by a need for revitalizing trade in order to pay [[tribute]] to the succession of empires that ruled [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Byblos]], and by fear of complete [[Greek colonization]] of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce. The Phoenicians lacked the population or necessity to establish large self-sustaining cities abroad, and most of their colonial cities had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, but Carthage and a few others developed larger populations.

==Carthaginian Control==
Some 300 colonies were established in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of Libya. The Phoenicians controlled [[Cyprus]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], and the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as minor possessions in [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]]; the latter settlements were in perpetual conflict with the Greeks. The Phoenicians managed to control all of Sicily for a limited time. The entire area later came under the leadership and protection of Carthage, which in turn dispatched its own colonists to found new cities or to reinforce those that declined with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]].

The first colonies were made on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth ? along the North African coast and on [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The centre of the Phoenician world was [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], serving as an economic and political hub. The power of this city waned following numerous sieges and its eventual destruction by [[Alexander the Great]], and the role as leader passed to [[Sidon]], and eventually to Carthage. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither had actual control of the colonies. This changed with the rise of Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the [[Punic Wars]].

==Treaty with Rome==
In 509 BC, a treaty was signed between Carthage and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].

==5th Century==
By the beginning of the 5th century BC, Carthage had become the commercial center of the West Mediterranean region, a position it retained until overthrown by the [[Roman Republic]]. The city had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. [[Hadrumetum]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], and [[Kerkouane]], subjugated the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribes (with the [[Numidian]] and Mauretanian kingdoms remaining more or less independent), and taken control of the entire North African coast from modern [[Morocco]] to the borders of [[Egypt]] (not including the [[Cyrenaica]], which was eventually incorporated into [[Hellenistic Egypt]]). Its influence had also extended into the Mediterranean, taking control over [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and the western half of [[Sicily]], where coastal fortresses such as [[Motya]] or [[Lilybaeum]] secured its possessions. Important colonies had also been established on the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Their cultural influence in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is documented, but the degree of their political influence before the conquest by [[Hamilcar Barca]] is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Barcelo, Pedro.

== The Sicilian Wars ==
{{further2|the [[Sicilian Wars]]}}

===First Sicilian war===
Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the [[Greeks]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean.

The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coast; battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries.

By 480 BC, [[Gelo]], the [[tyrant]] leader of Greek [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], backed in part by support from other Greek [[city-states]], was attempting to unite the island under his rule. This imminent threat could not be ignored, and Carthage ? possibly as part of an alliance with [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], then engaged military force, under the leadership of the general [[Hamilcar]]. Traditional accounts give Hamilcar's army a strength of three hundred thousand men; though these are almost certainly exaggerated, it must nonetheless have been of formidable force.

En route to Sicily, however, Hamilcar suffered losses (possibly severe) due to poor weather. Landing at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]), Hamilcar spent 3&amp;nbsp;days reorganizing his forces and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, and made camp before engaging in the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]]. Hamilcar was either killed during the battle or committed suicide in shame. As a result the nobility negotiated peace and replaced the old monarchy with a republic.

===Second Sicilian War===
By 410 BC, Carthage had recovered after serious defeats. It had conquered much of modern day [[Tunisia]], strengthened and founded new colonies in [[Maghreb|North Africa]], [[Hanno the Navigator]] had made  his journey down the African coast, and [[Himilco the Navigator]] had explored the European Atlantic coast. Although, in that year, the Iberian colonies seceded ? cutting off Carthage's major supply of [[silver]] and [[copper]] ? [[Hannibal Mago]], the grandson of Hamilcar, began preparations to reclaim Sicily, while expeditions were also led into [[Morocco]] and [[Senegal]], and also into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

In 409 BC, Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with his force. He was successful in capturing the smaller cities of Selinus (modern [[Selinunte]]) and [[Himera]], before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and, in [[405 BC]], Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the entire island. This time, however, he met with fierce resistance and ill-fortune. During the [[siege]] of [[Agrigentum]], the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. Although his successor, [[Himilco]], successfully extended the campaign by breaking a Greek siege, capturing the city of [[Gela]] and repeatedly defeating the army of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the new tyrant of Syracuse, he, too, was weakened by the plague and forced to [[sue for peace]] before returning to Carthage.

In 398 BC, Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of [[Motya]]. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself. The siege was close to a success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague again ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed.

Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next sixty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes. By 340 BC, Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island, and an uneasy peace reigned over the island.

===Third Sicilian War===
[[Image:NE 323bc.jpg|thumb|left|Mediterranean sea nations in 323 BC.]]
In 315 BC, [[Agathocles]], the tyrant (administrating governor) of Syracuse, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina). In [[311 BC]] he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]].

[[Hamilcar]], grandson of [[Hanno the Navigator]], led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By [[310 BC]], he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles' army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.

==Pyrrhic War==
{{main|Pyrrhic War}}
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|right||[[Trireme]] mosaic from Carthage, [[Bardo Museum]], Tunis.]]
Between 280 and 275 BC, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.

Pyrrhus sent an advance guard to Tarentium under the command of Cineaus with 3,000 [[infantry]]. Pyrrhus marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and engaged in battles with the Thessalians and the Athenian army. After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentium to rejoin with his advance guard.

In the midst of Pyrrhus's Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of [[Agrigentum]], [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Leontini]], asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:1?22:3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrhus agreed, and fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 [[infantry]] and 3,000 [[cavalry]] and 20 War Elephants, supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus'  Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of [[Erice|Eryx]], even though he was not able to capture [[Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:4?22:6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to [[Plutarch]], Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrrhus's campaigns in Italy were inconclusive, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its &quot;[[sphere of influence]]&quot;, bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].

==The Punic Wars==
{{further2|[[Punic Wars]]|[[First Punic War]]|[[Mercenary War]]|[[Second Punic War]]|[[Third Punic War]]}}
[[Image:CarthageElectrumCoin250BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Carthage [[electrum]] coin, ca. 250 BC. [[British Museum]].]]
[[Image:Carthaginianempire.PNG|thumb|right|Carthaginian dependencies and protectorates through the Punic Wars.]]
When Agathocles died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or &quot;sons of Mars&quot;), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero; alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.

As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.

The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]]. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], which nearly prevented the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].

In 266/265 BC the Romans, under the command of [[Regulus]], landed in Africa and after suffering some initial defeats the Carthaginian forces eventually repelled the Roman invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, Dexter. ''Truceless War: Carthage's Fight for Survival, 241 to 237 BC''. [[Brill Publishers]] 2007, ISBN 9004160760, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]] which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the [[Barcid]] family to prominence), and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]].

The [[Second Punic War]] lasted from [[218 BC|218]] to [[202 BC]] and involved combatants in the western and eastern [[Mediterranean]], with the participation of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] on Carthage's side. The war is marked by [[Hannibal]]'s surprising overland journey and his costly crossing of the Alps, followed by his reinforcement by Gaulish allies and crushing victories over Roman armies in the [[battle of the Trebia]] and the giant ambush at [[battle of Lake Trasimene|Trasimene]]. Against his skill on the battlefield the Romans deployed the [[Fabian strategy]]. But because of the increasing unpopularity of this approach, the Romans resorted to a further major field battle. The result was the Roman defeat at [[battle of Cannae|Cannae]].

In consequence many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade, during which more Roman armies were destroyed on the battlefield. Despite these setbacks, the Roman forces were more capable in siegecraft than the Carthaginians and recaptured all the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeating a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the [[battle of the Metaurus]]. In the meantime in Iberia, which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major]] took [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] by assault and ended Carthaginian rule over Iberia in the [[battle of Ilipa]]. The final showdown was the [[battle of Zama]] in Africa between Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, resulting in the latter's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage, which ceased to be a major power and became a Roman client-state.

The [[Third Punic War]] ([[149 BC]] to [[146 BC]]) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and primarily consisted of a single main action, the [[Battle of Carthage (c.149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]], but resulted in the complete destruction of the city of Carthage, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of the entire Carthaginian population. The Third Punic War ended Carthage's independent existence.

==Culture==
===Language===
Carthaginians spoke [[Punic language|Punic]], a variety of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] which was a [[Semitic]] language originating in the Carthaginians' original homeland of [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon).

===Economy===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}
[[File:Port circulaire laurier rose.jpg|thumb|left|Carthaginian port]]
Carthaginian commerce was by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic and by land across the Sahara desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians and others had treaties of commerce to regulate their exports and imports.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics Book 3,IX&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire of Carthage depended heavily on its trade with [[Tartessos]] and other cities of the Iberian peninsula, from which it obtained vast quantities of [[silver]], [[lead]], and, even more importantly, [[tin]] ore, which was essential for the manufacture of [[bronze]] objects by the civilizations of antiquity. Its trade relations with the Iberians and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on trade with tin-rich Britain and the Canary Islands allowed it to be the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze. Maintaining this monopoly was one of the major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage, and a Carthaginian merchant would rather crash his ship upon the rocky shores of Britain than reveal to any rival how it could be safely approached. In addition to being the sole significant distributor of tin, its central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern nations' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and the North African coast, and, after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 [[Talent (unit)|talent]]s) of silver a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Nat His'' 33,96&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the art of making the extremely valuable dye [[Tyrian Purple]]. It was one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. High Roman officials could only afford togas with a small stripe of it. Carthage also produced a less-valuable crimson pigment from the [[Kermes (genus)|kermes]], a [[scale insect]] local to the area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Carthage produced finely embroidered and dyed [[textiles]] of [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[wool]], and [[silk]], artistic and functional [[pottery]], [[faience]], [[incense]], and perfumes. Its artisans worked with glass, wood, [[alabaster]], ivory, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, highly admired furniture and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows, jewelry, arms, implements, and household items. It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce, and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products of almost every Mediterranean people.

[[File:Head man Carthage Louvre AO3783.jpg|thumb|Punic pendant in the form of a bearded head, 4th?3rd century BC.]]
In addition to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, and crop rotation. [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]] wrote a famous treatise on agriculture which the Romans ordered translated after Carthage was captured. After the Second Punic War, [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] promoted agriculture to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 33,51&lt;/ref&gt;), and he was largely successful.

Carthage produced wine, which was highly prized in Rome, [[Etruria]] (the [[Etruscans]]), and Greece. Rome was a major consumer of raisin wine, a Carthaginian specialty. Fruits, nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown, and olive oil was exported in competition with Greece. Carthage also raised fine horses, similar to today's [[Arabian horse]]s, which were greatly prized and exported.

Carthage's merchant ships, which surpassed even those of the cities of the [[Levant]], visited every major port of the Mediterranean, Britain, the coast of Africa, and the [[Canary Islands]]. These ships were able to carry over 100 tons of goods. The commercial fleet of Carthage was comparable in size and tonnage to the fleets of major European powers in the 18th century.

Merchants at first favored the ports of the east: Egypt, the Levant, Greece, Cyprus, and Asia Minor. But after Carthage's control of Sicily brought it into conflict with Greek colonists, it established commercial relations in the western Mediterranean, including trade with the [[Etruscans]].

Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and [[Persia]]. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia and tin from the Canary Islands. From the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts, they obtained amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. Carthage supplied poorer civilizations with simple things, such as pottery, metallic products, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered white warriors into Northern African slavery).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

These trade ships went all the way down the Atlantic coast of Africa to [[Senegal]] and Nigeria. One account has a Carthaginian trading vessel exploring Nigeria, including identification of distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with gorillas (See [[Hanno the Navigator]]). Irregular trade exchanges occurred as far west as Madeira and the [[Canary Islands]], and as far south as southern Africa. Carthage also traded with [[History of India|India]] by traveling through the [[Red Sea]] and the perhaps-mythical lands of [[Ophir]] (India/Arabia?) and [[Land of Punt|Punt]], which may be present-day [[Somalia]].

Archaeological finds show evidence of all kinds of exchanges, from the vast quantities of tin needed for a bronze-based metals civilization to all manner of textiles, ceramics and fine metalwork. Before and in between the wars, Carthaginian merchants were in every port in the Mediterranean, buying and selling, establishing warehouses where they could, or just bargaining in open-air markets after getting off their ships.

The Etruscan language has not yet been deciphered, but archaeological excavations of Etruscan cities show that the Etruscan civilization was for several centuries a customer and a vendor to Carthage, long before the rise of Rome. The Etruscan city-states were, at times, both commercial partners of Carthage and military allies.

Carthage remained to a great extent an [[oligarchy|oligarchal]] [[republic]], which relied on a system of [[checks and balances]] and ensured a form of public accountability. At the head of the Carthaginian state were now two annually elected, not hereditary, [[Shofet|Suffets]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}(thus rendered in Latin by [[Livy]] 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SP?M {{IPA|/?uft?im/}}, meaning &quot;judges&quot; and obviously related to the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ruler title {{lang|he-Latn|''Shophet''}}  &quot;[[Biblical Judges|Judge]]&quot;), similar to modern day executive [[president]]s. Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as &quot;kings&quot;. SP? {{IPA|/?ufit?/}} might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre. A [[List of monarchs of Carthage|list of the hereditary suffetes/&quot;kings&quot; can be found here.]]

In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to [[Roman consul]]s (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;  A range of more junior officials and special commissioners oversaw different aspects of governmental business such as public works, tax-collecting, and the administration of the state treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian &quot;[[Senate]]&quot;, and Greek ones of a &quot;council of [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]&quot; or a [[gerousia]]), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military, as generals were chosen by the administration.  The final supervision of the Treasury and Foreign Affairs seems to have come under the Council of Elders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}.

There was a body known as the Tribunal of the [[Hundred and Four]], which Aristotle compared to the Spartan [[ephors]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristiotle, Politics, Book 2, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; These were judges who acted as a kind of higher constitutional court and oversaw the actions of generals {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, who could sometimes be sentenced to [[crucifixion]], as well as other officials.  Panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, war appointed from the Tribunal of One Hundred and Four:  they appear to have deal with a variety of affairs of state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}.

Although the city's administration was firmly controlled by oligarchs {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, democratic elements were to be found as well: Carthage had elected legislators, trade unions and town meetings in the form of a Popular Assembly.  [[Aristotle]] reported in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote - unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].  [[Polybius]], in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline).  This may have been due to the influence of the [[Barcid]] faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

[[Eratosthenes]], head of the [[Library of Alexandria]], noted that the Greeks had been wrong to describe all non-Greeks as barbarians, since the Carthaginians as well as the Romans had a constitution. [[Aristotle]] also knew and discussed the Carthaginian constitution in his ''Politics'' (Book II, Chapter 11). During the period between the end of the First Punic War and the end of the Second Punic War, members of the [[Barcid]] family dominated in Carthaginian politics. They were given control of the Carthaginian military and all the Carthaginian territories outside of Africa.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Carthage}}
Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion (derived from the faiths of the [[Levant]]), a form of [[polytheism]]. Many of the gods the Carthaginians worshiped were localized and are now known only under their local names. It also had [[Jewish]] communities (which still exist; see [[Tunisian Jews]] and [[Algerian Jews]]).

===Pantheon===
[[File:Carthage EL shekel 2250013.jpg|thumb|Carthaginian coins from circa 310-290 BC showing the wreathed head of [[Tanit]]]]
The supreme divine couple was that of [[Tanit]] and [[Ba%27al_Hammon#Ba.27al_of_Carthage|Ba'al Hammon]]. The goddess [[Astarte]] seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of Greece, Egypt and the Etruscan city-states. A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.

===Caste of priests and acolytes===
Surviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices. Priests were clean shaven, unlike most of the population. In the first centuries of the city ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.

===Punic stelae===
[[File:Karthago Tophet 2.JPG|thumb|Stelae on the Tophet]]
[[Cippi]] and [[stelae]] of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, and are found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute striking relics of Punic civilization.

===Child sacrifice question===
&lt;!--
Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

--&gt;

Carthage under the Phoenicians was criticized by its neighbors for [[child sacrifice]]. [[Plutarch]] (''c.'' 46?120) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Philo]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus. Trans. C.H. Oldfather. ''Diodorus of Sicily 1, VI, VIII, IX''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1954-1963 (The Loeb Classical Library).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Herodotos]] and [[Polybius]] do not. Skeptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, p252&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions child sacrifice practiced by the [[Canaan]]ites, ancestors of the Carthaginians. The Greek and Roman critics, according to Charles Picard, objected not to the killing of children but to the religious nature of it. As in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient children were not uncommonly killed by exposure to the elements. However, the Greeks and Romans engaged in the practice for economic rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Carthage Gilbert and Colette Charels-Picard pp149-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[archaeology]] in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infants or children who died very early.&lt;ref&gt;Carhtage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, pp251&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ualberta.ca/~kmacfarl/CLASS_110/5.HittitesPhoeneciansIsraelites.html Kelly A. MacFarlane, University of Alberta, ''Hittites and Phoenician'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a single child cemetery called the [[Tophet]] by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC, with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and 2-year-olds. These remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not possible to know why. The correlation could be because bad times inspired the Carthaginians to pray for divine intervention (via child sacrifice), or because bad times increased child mortality, leading to more child burials (via cremation).

Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in Tophet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage's priests demanded the flower of their youth in times of crisis or calamity like war, drought or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.{{Citation needed|reason=Long, and detailed, with very relevant information: But badly needs a citation|date=February 2010}}

Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was &quot;a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were &quot;offered&quot; to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, &quot;Beliefs and Religious Life&quot; in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.

{{refimprove|date=May 2011}}The study of the '''history of [[Carthage]]''' is often problematic. Due to the subjugation of the civilization by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]], very few Carthaginian [[primary source|historical primary sources]] survive. There are a few ancient translations of [[Punic]] texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Jongeling| first = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of available primary source material about Carthaginian civilization was written by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians, such as [[Livy]], [[Polybius]], [[Appian]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dio Cassius]], and [[Herodotus]].

These authors came from cultures which were nearly always in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage.  The Greeks contested with Carthage for [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, V2. pp 165?7&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] fought the [[Punic Wars]] against Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''World History'': 1.7?1.60&lt;/ref&gt; Inevitably the accounts of Carthage written by outsiders include significant bias. Recent excavation of ancient Carthaginian sites has brought much more primary material to light. Some of these finds contradict or confirm aspects of the traditional picture of Carthage, but much of the material is still ambiguous.

== Beginning ==
Carthage was one of a number of Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean that was created to facilitate trade from the cities of Sidon, Tyre and others from [[Phoenicia]], which was situated in the coast of what is now Lebanon and Palestine. In the [[10th century BC]], the eastern Mediterranean shore was inhabited by various [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking populations, who had built up flourishing civilizations. The people inhabiting what is now Lebanon, were referred to as ''Phoenicians'' by the [[Greek people|Greeks]]. The [[Phoenician language]] was very close to ancient Hebrew, to such a degree that the latter is often used as an aid in translation of Phoenician inscriptions.

The Phoenician cities were highly dependent on both land- and seaborne trade and their cities included a number of major ports in the area. In order to provide a resting place for their merchant fleets, to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resource, or to conduct trade on its own, the Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean, stretching from Iberia to the Black Sea. They were stimulated to found their cities by a need for revitalizing trade in order to pay the tribute extracted from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Byblos]] by the succession of empires that ruled them and later by fear of complete Greek colonization of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce. The initial Phoenician colonization took place during a time when other neighboring kingdoms (Greek, Hittite, Cretan) were suffering from a ?Dark Age?, perhaps after the activities of the [[Sea Peoples]].

===Extent of Phoenician settlement===
The Phoenicians' leading city was [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], which established a number of trading posts around the Mediterranean. Ultimately Phoenicians established 300 colonies in [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of [[Libya]]. The Phoenicians lacked the population or necessity to establish self-sustaining cities abroad, and most cities had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, but Carthage and a few other cities later developed into large, self sustaining, independent cities. The Phoenicians controlled [[Cyprus]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], and the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as obtained minor possessions in [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]]; the latter settlements were in perpetual conflict with the Greeks. The Phoenicians managed to control Sicily for a limited time, but Phoenician control did not extend inland and was limited to the coast only.

The first colonies were made on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth?along the African coast and on Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The center of the Phoenician world was Tyre, serving as an economic and political hub. The power of this city waned following numerous sieges and its eventual destruction by [[Alexander the Great]], and the role as leader passed to [[Sidon]], and eventually to Carthage. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither mother city had actual control of the colonies. This changed with the rise of Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the [[Punic Wars]].

===Trade===
Ancient sources concur that Carthage had become perhaps the wealthiest city in the world via its trade and commerce, yet few remains of its riches. This is due to the fact that most of it was short-lived materials?[[textiles]], unworked metal, foodstuffs, and [[slaves]]; its trade in fabricated goods was only a part of its wares. There can be no doubt that the most fruitful trade was that acquired from the [[Phoenicians]] in the western [[Mediterranean]], in which [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[iron]] were gained in return for consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclop?dia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
Carthage was founded by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who brought with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]]. [[Philistos of Syracuse]] dates the founding of Carthage to ''c.'' 1215 BC, while the Roman historian [[Appian]] dates the founding 50 years prior to the [[Trojan War]] (''i.e.'' between 1244 and 1234 BC, according to the chronology of [[Eratosthenes]]). The Roman poet [[Publius Vergilius Maro|Virgil]] imagines that the city's founding coincides with the end of the Trojan War. However, it is most likely that the city was founded sometime between 846 and 813 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, ''Carthage: A History'', pp 21-31 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation myths===
According to tradition, the city was founded by Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (or Elissa or Elissar) who fled Tyre following the murder of her husband in an attempt by her younger brother, the King of Tyre, to bolster his own power. A number of foundation myths have survived through [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Roman literature]], see [[Byrsa]] for one example.

==== Queen Elissar ====
Queen Elissar (also known as &quot;Elissa&quot;, and by the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] name {{lang|ar|??????}} also {{lang|ar|?????}} and {{lang|ar|?????}}) who in later accounts became ''Queen Dido'', was a princess of Tyre who founded the city of Carthage.  At its peak her metropolis came to be called the &quot;shining city&quot;, ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean and leading the Phoenician Punic world.

Elissar was the Princess of Tyre, married to the High Priest of the city, who was wealthy and enjoyed widespread respect and power among the citizens. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissar was the daughter of King Matten of Tyre (also known as Muttoial or Belus II). When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]]. She married her uncle Acherbas (also known as Sychaeus) High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, and desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas. Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and managed to keep the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single [[sovereign]], causing dissent within the royal family.

After learning the truth, Elissar fled Tyre with her husband's gold, and managed to trick the Tyrian ships sent in pursuit to join her fleet. When her ship was overtaken by the Tyrian ships, she threatened to throw the gold overboard and let the would-be captors face the wrath of her brother for failing their mission. They opted to join her, and the augmented fleet sailed on towards the West. Elissa eventually sailed to Africa after a brief stop at Cyprus, where she rescued 80 virgins from a temple. She requested land to establish a new city from the king of the Libyan tribe living near [[Byrsa]] after reaching Africa. Told that she could have as much land that can be covered by an oxhide, she cut the hide into thin strips and managed to surround the hill of Byrsa. The initial city of Carthage was founded on the spot. When the Libyan king later sought to marry her, which would have caused the city to become part of the king's domain, she chose instead to kill herself.

==== Queen Dido ====
In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil gives a tale of how Queen Dido of Carthage - which had become a prosperous kingdom under her rule - meets the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]] who himself has fled the sack of [[Troy]] with a small band of Trojans to settle in the west. Dido and Aeneas fall in love, but when the Trojans depart Carthage for Italy (as is their destiny), Dido commits suicide. At the same time she curses Aeneas and all his future descendants and countrymen - the future Romans.

== Colony of Tyre ==
Little is known of the internal history and dealings of the early Phoenician city.  The initial city covered the area around Byrsa, paid an annual tribute to the nearby Libyan tribes, and may have been ruled by a governor from Tyre, whom the Greeks identified as &quot;king&quot;.  [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], then the leading Phoenician city in Africa, aided the early settlement in her dealings. The date from which Carthage can be counted as an independent power cannot exactly be determined, and probably nothing distinguished Carthage from the other Phoenician colonies in Africa during 800 - 700 BC.

It has been noted that the culture of Phoenician colonies had gained a distinct &quot;Punic&quot; characteristic by the end of the 7th century BC, indicating the emergence of a distinct culture in Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 81-83 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 650 BC, Carthage planted her own colony,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, 5.15.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; and in 600 BC, she was warring with Greeks on her own away from the African mainland. By the time King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of Babylon was conducting the 13-year siege of Tyre starting from 585 BC, Carthage was probably independent of her mother city in political matters. However, close ties with Tyre still remained, Carthage continued to send annual tribute to Tyre (for the temple of Melqart) at irregular intervals over the centuries. Carthage inherited no colonial empire from Tyre and had to build her own. It is likely that Carthage did not have an empire prior to 6th century BC.

Exactly what social/political/geographic/military factors influenced the citizens of Carthage, and not the other Mediterranean Phoenician colonial members to create an economic and political hegemony is not clearly known. The city of Utica was far older than Carthage and enjoyed the same geographical/political advantages as Carthage, but it opted to be an allied entity, not a leader of the Punic hegemony that came into being probably sometime around the 6th century BC. When the Phoenician trade monopoly was challenged by [[Etruscans]] and Greeks in the west and their political and economic independence by successive empires in the east, Phoenician influence from the mainland decreased in the west and Punic Carthage ultimately emerged at the head of a commercial empire. One theory is that refugees from Phoenicia swelled the population and enhanced the culture of Carthage during the time the Phoenician homeland came under attack from the Babylonians and Persians, transferring the tradition of Tyre to Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 10-11 ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of Carthaginian Hegemony==
The mainland Greeks began their colonization efforts in the western Mediterranean with the founding of [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] and [[Cumae]] in Sicily and Italy respectively, and by 650 BC Phoenicians in Sicily had retreated to the western part of that island. Around this time the first recorded independent action by Carthage takes place, which is the colonization of [[Ibiza]]. By the end of the [[7th century BC]], Carthage was becoming one of the leading commercial centers of the West Mediterranean region, a position it retained until overthrown by the [[Roman Republic]]. Carthage would establish new colonies, repopulate old Phoenician ones, come to the defense of other Punic cities under threat from natives/Greeks, as well as expand her territories by conquest. While some Phoenician colonies willingly submitted to Carthage, paying [[tribute]] and giving up their [[foreign policy]], others in Iberia and Sardinia resisted Carthaginian efforts.

Carthage, unlike [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], did not concentrate on conquering lands adjacent to the city prior to embarking on overseas ventures. Her dependence on trade and focus on protecting that trade network saw the evolution of an overseas hegemony before Carthage pushed inland into Africa. It may be possible that the power of the Libyan tribes prevented expansion in the neighborhood of the city for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Titus, 34.62.12&lt;/ref&gt; Until 550 BC, Carthage paid rent to the Libyans for use of land in the city surroundings&lt;ref&gt;Justin, 17.5.14&lt;/ref&gt; and in Cape Bon for agricultural purposes. The Africa dominion controlled by Carthage was relatively small. The payment would be finally stopped around 450 BC, when the second major expansion inland into Tunisia would take place. Carthage probably colonized the [[Gulf of Gab?s|Syrtis]] region (Area between [[Thapsus]] in Tunisia and [[Sabratha]] in Libya) between 700-600 BC. Carthage also focused on bringing the existing Phoenician colonies along the African coast into the hegemony, but exact details are lacking. Emporia had fallen under Carthaginian influence prior to 509 BC, as the first treaty with Rome indicated. The eastward expansion of Carthaginian influence along the African coast (through what is now Libya) was blocked by the Greek colony of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (established 630 BC).

Carthage spread her influence along the west coast relatively unhindered, but the chronology is unknown. Wars with the Libyans, Numidians and [[Mauri]] took place but did not end with the creation of a Carthaginian empire like the one the Romans created almost half a millennium later.

=== Nature of the Hegemony ===
The degree of control Carthage exerted over her territories varied in their severity. In ways, the Carthaginian hegemony shared some of the characteristics of the [[Delian League]] (allies sharing defense expenditure), the [[Sparta|Spartan Kingdom]] (serfs tilling for the Punic elite and state) and to a lesser extent, the [[Roman Republic]] (allies contributing manpower/tribute to furnish the Roman war machine).

==== Conquered People ====
The African lands near to the city faced the harshest control measures, with Carthaginian officers administering the area and Punic troops garrisoning the cities. Many cities had to destroy their defensive walls, while the Libyans living in the area had few rights. The Libyans could own land&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, 20.8.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; but had to pay an annual tribute (50% of agricultural produce and 25% of their town income) and serve in the Carthaginian armies as conscripts.

==== Tributary Allies ====
Other Phoenician cities (Like [[Leptis Magna]]) paid an annual tribute and ran their own internal affairs, retained their defensive walls but had no independent foreign policy. Other cities had to provide personnel for the Punic army and the Punic navy along with tribute but retained internal autonomy. Allies like Utica and [[Gades]] were more independent and had their own government. Carthage stationed troops and some type of central administration in Sardinia and Iberia to control her domain. The cities, in return for surrendering these privileges, obtained Carthaginian protection, which provided the fleet to combat [[piracy]] and fought wars needed to protect these cities from external threats.

====Citizens and their status====
Carthaginian citizenship was more exclusive and the goal of the state was more focused on protecting the trade infrastructure than expanding the citizen body. The [[Roman Republic]], which in the course of her wars created an alliance system in Italy which, in addition to expanding her lands, also expanded her citizen body and military manpower by adding allies (with varying degrees of political rights). Carthage, while she continued to expand until 218 BC, did not have a similar system to increase her citizen numbers. She had treaties in place with various Punic and non-Punic cities (the most famous and well known ones being the ones with Rome), which detailed the rights of each power and their [[sphere of influence]]. The Punic cities not under direct Carthaginian control probably had similar treaties in place. The Libyo-Phoenicians, who lived in the African domain controlled by Carthage also had rights similar to those of Carthaginian citizens. The Carthaginian citizens were exempt from taxation and primarily involved in commerce as traders or industrial workers. As a result, Carthage, unlike the other agricultural nations, could not afford to have her citizens serve in a long war, as it diminished her commercial activities.

==The reign of &quot;Kings&quot;==
Carthage was initially ruled by &quot;kings&quot;, who were elected by the Carthaginian &quot;senate&quot; and served for a specific time period. The election took place in Carthage, and the kings at first were war leaders, civic administrators and performed certain religious duties. According to [[Aristotle]], kings were elected on merit, not by the people but by the senate, and the post was not hereditary. However, the crown and military commands could also be purchased by the highest bidder. Initially these kings may have enjoyed near absolute power, which was curtailed as Carthage moved towards a more democratic government. Gradually, military command fell to professional officers, and a pair of suffets replaced the king in some of the civic functions and eventually kings were no longer elected. Records show that two families had held the kingship with distinction during 550-310 BC. The [[Magonids|Magonid family]] produced several members who were elected kings between 550 BC and 370 BC, who were in the forefront of the overseas expansion of Carthage. Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;, along with his son and grandson, held the kingship for some years between 367 and 310 BC. Records of other elected kings or their impact on Carthaginian history are not available. The [[Shofet|suffets]], who would ultimately displace the kings, were elected by the people. Suffets would ultimately discard their military duties and become purely civic officials.

The Phoenicians encountered little resistance in developing their trade [[monopoly]] during 1100-900 BC. The emergence of the Etruscans as a sea power did little to dent the Phoenician trade. The power of the Etruscans was localized around Italy, and their trade with Corsica, Sardinia and Iberia had not hindered Phoenician activity. Trade had also developed between Punic and Etruscan cities, and Carthage had treaties with the Etruscan cities to regulate these activities, while mutual piracy had not led to full-blown war between the powers. Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy to discourage both pirates and rival nations. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, ultimately brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the [[Greeks]], the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean. In conducting these conflicts, which spanned between 600 - 310 BC, the overseas empire of Carthage also came into being under the military leadership of the &quot;kings&quot;. The Etruscans, also in conflict with the Greeks, became allies of Carthage in the ensuing struggle.

===Conflict with the Greeks===
{{Campaignbox Carthaginian Expansion}}

The nature of the conflict between Carthage and the Greeks was more due to economic factors rather than ideological and cultural differences. The Greeks did not wage a crusade to save the world from ''Imperium Barbaricum'' but to extend their own area of influence, neither was Carthage interested in wiping out Greek ideals. It was the vulnerability of the Carthaginian economy to Greek commercial competition that caused Carthage to take on the Greeks during the early years of her empire.

====Vulnerability of Punic trade====
The trade network which Carthage inherited from Tyre depended heavily on Carthage keeping commercial rivals at arm's length. The goods produced by Carthage were mainly for the local African market&lt;ref&gt;Markoe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, pp 104-05 ISBN 0-520-22614-3&lt;/ref&gt; and were initially inferior to Greek goods. Carthage was the middleman between mineral resource-rich Iberia and the east. She bartered low-priced goods for metals, then bartered those for finished goods in the east and distributed these through their network. The threat from the Greek colonists was threefold:
*Undercutting the Phoenicians by offering better products
*Taking over the distribution network
*Preying on Punic shipping

While the Greek colonies also offered increased opportunities for trade and piracy, their nosing into areas of Punic influence caused the Punic cities to look for protection from their strongest city. Carthage took up the challenge.

===Greeks go West===
The Greek colonization in the Western Mediterranean started with the establishment of [[Cumae]] in Italy and [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] in Sicily after 750 BC. Over the next century, hundreds of Greek colonies sprang up along the Southern Italian and Sicilian coastlines (except Western Sicily). There are no records of Phoenicians initially clashing with Greeks over territory; in fact, the Phoenicians had withdrawn to the Western corner of Sicily in the face of Greek expansion. However, the situation changed sometime after 638 BC, when the first Greek trader visited [[Tartessos]], and by 600 BC Carthage was actively warring with the Greeks to curb their colonial expansion. By 600 BC, the once-Phoenician lake had turned into a conflict zone with the Greeks rowing about in all corners. Carthaginian interests in Iberia, Sardinia and Sicily were threatened, which led to a series of conflicts between Carthage and various Greek city-states.

Twenty years after the establishment of [[Massalia]], the Phoenician cities in Sicily repelled an invasion of Dorian Greek settlers in Sicily while aiding the [[Elymian]]s of [[Segesta]] against the Greek city of [[Selineus]] in 580 BC. The result was the defeated Greeks establishing themselves in Lipera, which became a pirate hub, a threat to all commerce (Greek included). Shortly after this event, Carthaginians under a &quot;king&quot; called Malchus warred successfully against the Libyan tribes in Africa, and then defeated the Greeks in Sicily, sending a part of the Sicilian booty to Tyre as tribute to Melquart. Malchus next moved to Sardinia, but suffered a severe defeat against the natives. He and his entire army were banished by the Carthaginian senate. They in turn returned to Africa and besieged Carthage, which duly surrendered. Malchus assumed power, but was later deposed and executed. The Carthaginian army, which up to this point had been a predominantly citizen militia, became one primarily made up of mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 12-13,ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyrene and Carthage====
No records of any confrontations between the two powers are available, but a legend describes how the powers agreed on a border in [[Libya]].

Two pairs of champions set out for Carthage and Cyrene on the same day, each pair running towards the other city. When the runners met, the Carthaginian pair had covered more ground. Accused of cheating by the Greeks, they consented to be buried alive on the meeting spot, so that the territory between that spot and Carthage would become part of the Carthaginian domain. The Carthaginian champions were brothers, called  Philaenus, and the border was marked by two pillars called the &quot;Altars of the Philaeni&quot;. The African territorial boundary between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires was later set on this spot.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, ''Carthage: A History'', pp 92-94 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mago and the Magonids===
[[Mago I of Carthage|Mago I]], a general of the army, had assumed power in Carthage by 550 BC. Mago and his sons, [[Hasdrubal I of Carthage|Hasdrubal I]] and [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar I]], established the warlike tradition of Carthage by their successes in Africa, Sicily and Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XIX, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 546 BC, Phocaeans fleeing from a Persian invasion established [[Alalia]] in Corsica (Greeks had settled there since 562 BC), and began preying on Etruscan and Punic commerce. Between 540 and 535 BC, a Carthaginian-Etruscan alliance had expelled the Greeks from Corsica after the [[Battle of Alalia]]. The Etruscans took control of Corsica, Carthage concentrated on Sardinia, ensuring that no Greek presence would be established in the island. The defeat also ended the westward expansion of Greeks for all time.

A war with Greek Massalia followed. Carthage lost battles but managed to safeguard Phoenician Iberia and close the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to Greek shipping,&lt;ref&gt;Casson, Lionel, The Ancient Mariners, pp 74-75, ISBN 0-691-01477-9&lt;/ref&gt; while Massalians retained their Iberian colonies in Eastern Iberia above Cape Nao.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, p 11, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Iberia was closed to the Greeks. Carthaginians in support of the Phoenician colony [[Gades]] in Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XLIII, 5, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; also brought about the collapse of [[Tartessos]] in Iberia by 530 BC, either by armed conflict or by cutting off Greek trade. Carthage also besieged and took over Gades at this time. The Persians had taken over Cyrene by this time, and Carthage may have been spared a trial of arms against the Persian Empire when the Phoenicians refused to lend ships to [[Cambyses]] in 525 BC for an African expedition. Carthage may have paid tribute irregularly to the Great King. It is not known if Carthage had any role in the [[Battle of Cumae]] in 524 BC, after which Etruscan power began to wane in Italy.

Hasdrubal, the son of Mago, was elected as &quot;king&quot; eleven times, was granted a triumph four times (the only Carthaginian to receive this honor - there is no record of anyone else being given similar treatment by Carthage) and had died of his battle wounds received in Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XIX, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage had engaged in a 25-year struggle in Sardinia, where the natives may have received aid from [[Sybaris]], then the richest city in Magna Gracia and an ally of the Phocaeans. The Carthaginians faced resistance from [[Nora, Italy|Nora]] and [[Sulci]] in Sardinia, while [[Carales]] and [[Tharros]] had submitted willingly to Carthaginian rule.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.isolasarda.com/nora-storia_e.htm] History of Nora&lt;/ref&gt; Hasdrubal?s war against the Libyans failed to stop the annual tribute payment.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 257, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthaginians managed to defeat and drive away the colonization attempt near Leptis Manga in Libya by the Spartan prince [[Dorieus]] after a three-year war (514-511 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 91-93, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; Dorieus was later defeated and killed at [[Eryx]] in Sicily in 510 BC while attempting to establish a foothold in Western Sicily. Hamilcar, either the brother or nephew (son of Hanno)&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, VII, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; of Hasdrubal, followed him to power in Carthage. Hamilcar had served with Hasdrubal in Sardinia and had managed to put down the revolt of Sardinians which had started in 509 BC.

====Treaty with Rome====
{{main|Treaties between Rome and Carthage}}

Carthage had concluded treaties with several powers, but those with Rome are the most well known. In [[509 BC]], a treaty was signed between Carthage and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], as well as Emporia and the area south of [[Cape Bon]] in Africa. Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily.

By the end of the [[6th Century BC]], Carthage had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. [[Hadrumetum]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Kerkouane]], subjugated some of the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribes, and had taken control of parts of the North African coast from modern [[Morocco]] to the borders of [[Cyrenaica]]. It was also fighting wars in defense of Punic colonies and commerce. However, only the details of her struggle against the Greeks have survived - which often makes Carthage seem &quot;obsessed with Sicily&quot;.

====First Sicilian War====

The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena in which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries. Carthage had to contend with at least three Greek incursions, in 580 BC, in 510 BC and a war in which the city of Heraclea was destroyed. [[Gelo]] had fought in the last war and had secured terms for the Greeks.

The Punic domain in Sicily by 500 BC contained the cities of Motya, [[Panormus]] and [[Soluntum]]. By 490 BC, Carthage had concluded treaties with the Greek cities of [[Selinus]], [[Himera]], and [[Zankle]] in Sicily. Gelo, the [[tyrant]] of Greek [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], backed in part by support from other Greek [[city-states]], had been attempting to unite the island under his rule since 485 BC. When [[Theron]] of Akragas, father-in-law of Gelo, deposed the tyrant of Himera in 483 BC, Carthage decided to intervene at the instigation of the tyrant of [[Rhegion]], who was the father-in-law of the deposed tyrant of Himera.

Hamilcar prepared the largest Punic overseas expedition to date and, after three years of preparations, sailed for Sicily. This enterprise coincided with the expedition of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] against mainland Greece in 480 BC, prompting speculations about a possible alliance between Carthage and Persia against the Greeks, although no documentary evidence of this exists. The Punic fleet was battered by storms en route, and the Punic army was destroyed and Hamilcar killed in the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]] by the combined armies of Himera, Akragas and Syracuse under Gelo. Carthage made peace with the Greeks and paid a large indemnity of 2000 silver talents, but lost no territory in Sicily.

==A republican empire==
This defeat had far reaching consequences, both political and economic, for Carthage. Politically, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic. The ?King? was still elected, but their power began to erode, with the senate and the &quot;Tribunal of 104&quot; gaining dominance in political matters, and the position of &quot;Suffet&quot; becoming more influential. Economically, sea-borne trade with the Middle East was cut off by the mainland Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Thucidides, VI, p34&lt;/ref&gt; and Magna Gracia boycotted Carthaginian traders. This led to the development of trade with the West and of caravan-borne trade with the East. Gisco, son of Hamilcar was exiled, and Carthage for the next 70 years made no recorded forays against the Greeks nor aided either the Elymians/Sicels or the Etruscans, then locked in struggle against the Greeks, or sent any aid to the Greek enemies of Syracuse, then the leading Greek city in Sicily. Based on this abstinence from Greek affairs, it is assumed that Carthage was crippled after the defeat of Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, p 16-18, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===How far crippled?===
If Carthage was indeed crippled, she was not immobile. Focus was shifted on expansion in Africa and Sardinia, and on the exploration of Africa and Europe for new markets. The grandsons of Mago I, Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Sappho (sons of Hasdrubal), together with Hanno, Gisco and Himilco (sons of Hamilcar) are said to have played prominent parts in these activities,&lt;ref&gt;Justin XIX pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; but specific details of their roles are lacking. By 450 BC, Carthage had finally stopped paying tribute to the Libyans,&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 256-258, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; and a line of forts was built in Sardinia, securing Carthaginian control over the island coastline.

Hanno, son of Hamilcar may be the famous [[Hanno the Navigator]],&lt;ref&gt;Heeren, IV p 539&lt;/ref&gt; which places his expedition around 460&amp;ndash;425 BC, and Himilco may be the same as [[Himilco the Navigator]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, H.N. II, p 67&lt;/ref&gt; which puts his expedition sometimes after 450 BC. Hanno the Navigator sailed down the African coast as far as Cameroon, and Himilco the Navigator explored the European Atlantic coast up to England in search of tin. These expeditions took place when Carthage was at the zenith of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, H.N. II p 67, VI p 36&lt;/ref&gt; If Hanno and Himilco are indeed related to Mago, then Carthage had recovered quite rapidly from her &quot;crippled&quot; state. If Hanno and Himilco are not of the Magoniod family, then these expeditions may have taken place before 500 BC and Cathage might have been crippled for 70 years.

Carthage took no known part in the activities of the Sicilian chief [[Ducetius]] in Sicily against Syracuse, nor in the wars between Akrages and Syracuse, or the battles of the Etruscans against Syracuse and Cumae. Carthage's fleet also took no recorded part in the shattering defeat of the Etruscan fleet at the naval [[Battle of Cumae]] in 474 BC at the hands of the Greeks. She sat out the [[Peloponnesian War]], refused to aid Segesta against Selinus in 415 BC and Athens against Syracuse in 413 BC. Nothing is known of any military activities Carthage might have taken in Africa or Iberia during this time. In 410 BC, Segesta, under attack from Selinus, appealed to Carthage again. The Carthaginian senate agreed to send help.

By [[410 BC]], Carthage had conquered much of modern day [[Tunisia]], strengthened and founded new colonies in North Africa, and had sponsored [[Mago Barca]]'s journey across the [[Sahara Desert]], Although, in that year, the Iberian colonies seceded ? cutting off Carthage's major supply of [[silver]] and [[copper]].

== The Sicilian see-saw ==
{{further2|the [[Sicilian Wars]]}}

===Second Sicilian War===
&quot;King&quot; Hannibal Mago (son of Gisco and grandson of Hamilcar, who had died at Himera in 480 BC), led a small force to Sicily to aid Segesta, and defeated  the army of Selinus in 410 BC. Hannibal Mago invaded Sicily with a larger force in 409 BC, landed at Motya and stormed Selinus (modern [[Selinunte]]); which fell before Syracuse could intervene effectively. Hannibal then attacked and destroyed [[Himera]] despite Syracusan intervention. 3,000 Greek prisoners were executed by Hannibal after the battle to avenge the death of Hamilcar at Himera, and the city was utterly destroyed. The Carthaginians did not attack Syracuse or Akragus, but departed for Africa with the spoils of war, and a three-year lull fell in Sicily.

In retaliation for Greek raids on Punic Sicilian possessions in [[406 BC]],  Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition, perhaps aiming to subjugate all Sicily. Carthaginians first moved against Akragas, during the [[siege]] of which the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. His kinsman and successor, [[Himilco]] (the son of Hanno&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XIV, p41&lt;/ref&gt;), successfully captured Akragus, then captured the cities of [[Gela]] and [[Camarina]] while repeatedly defeating the army of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the new tyrant of Syracuse, in battle. Himilco ultimately concluded a treaty with Dionysius (an outbreak of plague may have caused this), which allowed the Greek settlers to return to Selinus, Akragus, Camarina and Gela, but these were made tributary to Carthage. The Elymian and Sicel cities were kept free of both Punic and Greek dominion, and Dionysius, who had usurped power in Syracuse, was confirmed as tyrant of Syracuse. The home-bound Punic army carried the plague back to Carthage.

====Dionysius the Elder====
{{Campaignbox Sicilian Wars}}
Dionysius ruled for 38 years and engaged in four wars against Carthage with varying results. In [[398 BC]], after building up the power of Syracuse while Carthage was suffering from the plague, Dionysius broke the peace treaty. His soldiers massacred the Carthaginian traders in Syracuse, and Dionysius then besieged, captured and destroyed the Carthaginian city of [[Motya]] in Western Sicily while foiling the relief effort of Himilco through a brilliant stratagem. Himilco, who had been elected &quot;king&quot;, responded decisively the following year, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself after Mago, his kinsman, crushed the Greek fleet off Catana. The siege met with great success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed under Syracusan attack. Himilco paid an indemnity of 300 talents for safe passage of Carthaginian citizens to Dionysius. He abandoned his mercenaries and sailed to Carthage, only to commit suicide after publicly assuming full responsibility for the debacle (After his death, the power of &quot;kings&quot; would be severely curtailed, and the power of the oligarchy, ruling through the &quot;Council of Elders&quot; and the newly created &quot;Tribunal of 104,&quot; correspondingly increased).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 114, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague, brought back from Sicily, ravaged Carthage and a severe rebellion in Africa occurred at the same time. Carthage was besieged and her naval power was crucial in supplying the city. Himilco was succeeded by his kinsman Mago, who was occupied with subduing the rebellion while Dionysius consolidated his power in Sicily. The next clash against Carthage took place during 393 BC. Mago, in an attempt to aid the Sicels under attack from Syracuse, was defeated by Dionysius. Carthage reinforced Mago in 392 BC, but before he could engage the forces of Dionysius the Sicels had switched sides. The Carthaginian army was outmaneuvered by Dionysius, and peace soon followed, which allowed Carthage to retain her domain in Sicily while allowing Syracuse a free hand against the Sicels. The treaty lasted nine years.

Dionysius began the next war in 383 BC, but details of the first 4 years of clashes are unavailable. Carthage sent a force under Mago to Southern Italy for the first time to aid Italian Greeks against Syracuse in 379 BC. The expedition met with success, but during the same year, Libyans and Sardinians revolted, and a plague again swept through Africa. The stalemate in Sicily was broken when Dionysius defeated and killed Mago at the battle of Cabala in 378 BC (Mago was the last &quot;suffet&quot; to lead troops personally in battle. The Magonid dynasty ended with the death of his son Himilco).

Carthage initiated peace negotiations, which dragged for a year but ultimately faltered. Dionysius had consolidated his gains during the lull, and attacked Punic Sicily. He was decisively defeated in the battle of Cronium in 376 BC by Himilco, the son of Mago. Carthage did not follow up the victory but settled for  an indemnity payment of 1000 talents and restoration of  Carthaginian holdings in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 20-21, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of how or when Carthage subdued the African and Sardinian rebellion.

Dionysius initiated hostilities again in 368 BC, and after initial successes besieged [[Lilybaeum]], but the defeat of his fleet at [[Drepanum]] led to a stalemate and the war ended with his death in 367 BC. Carthaginian holdings west of the Halycas river remained secure. Hanno, a wealthy aristocrat, was in command in Sicily, and he and his family played a leading role in the politics of Carthage for the next fifty years. Carthage had entered into an alliance with the Etruscans, while [[Tarentum]] and Syracuse concluded a similar treaty.

==Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;==
A power struggle saw Hanno eventually depose his rival Suniatus (Leader of the Council of Elders) through the judicial process and execute him).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 115, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; With Sicily secure, Carthage launched campaigns in Libya, Spain and Mauretania, which eventually earned Hanno the title &quot;Magnus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XX,5, XXI, 4&lt;/ref&gt; along with great wealth, while Hamilcar and Gisco, his sons, served with distinction in the campaigns. However, Hanno aimed to obtain total power and planned to overthrow the &quot;Council of Elders&quot;. His scheme failed, leading to his execution along with Hamilcar and most of his family. Gisco was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty with Rome===
Carthage and Rome (by now a significant power in Central Italy), concluded a second treaty in 348 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lazanby, J.F, The First Punic War, pp 31-33, ISBN 1-85728-136-5&lt;/ref&gt; Romans were allowed to trade in Sicily, but not to settle there, and Iberia, Sardinia and Libya were forbidden to Roman exploration, trade and settlement activities. Romans were to hand over any settlements they captured there to Carthage. Carthaginians pledged to be friendly with the Latins, and return to Rome cities captured in [[Latium]] (The Latin League would be incorporated into the Roman Republic by 338 BC), and not to spend the night in Roman territory under arms.  This shows that the Iberian Phoenician colonies were in the Carthaginian &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; by 348 BC.

===Sicily Again===
The death of Dionysius ultimately led to a power struggle between [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]] and other aspirants.
The Punic holdings in Sicily were secure as Syracuse had begun to lose its hegemony over other Sicilian cities because of internal political conflict that turned to open warfare. Carthage had done little directly during 366 -346 BC to interfere, but in 343 BC decided to oppose [[Timoleon]]. Carthaginian army and fleet activity failed to stop his assumption of power in Syracuse. Mago, the Carthaginian commander, had the advantage of numbers, the support of allied Greeks, and was even admitted into Syracuse. But he bungled so much that he killed himself instead of facing the tribunal of 104 after returning to Carthage.

Timoleon managed to gain support of the tyrants in league with Carthage, and the Punic expedition sent to Sicily in retaliation of Syracusan raids was crushed in the [[Battle of the Crimissus]] in 341 BC by the combined Greek force. Gisco, the son of Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot; was recalled and elected as &quot;king&quot;, but he achieved little and after Timoleon had captured some pro-Carthaginian Greek cities, a peace treaty was concluded in 338 BC. The accord left the Punic possessions in Sicily unchanged,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI, 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; with Syracuse free to deal with other cities in Sicily.

==Alexander and the Diadochi==
While Carthage was engaged in Sicily, the rise of Macedon under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and [[Alexander the Great]] saw the defeat of Greek city states and the fall of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. All the mainland Phoenician cities had submitted to Alexander except Tyre, which was besieged and sacked in 332 BC, while the Carthaginian citizens present in the city were spared. Carthage sent two delegations to Alexander, one in 332 BC and another in 323 BC, but little was achieved. Alexander was raising a fleet in Cilicia for the invasion of Carthage, Italy and Iberia when he died, sparing Carthage an ordeal. Battles among the Diadochi and the ultimate 3 way struggle between Antagonid Macedon, Ptolemic Egypt and Selucid Syria spared Carthage any further clashes with the successor states for some time. Trade relations were opened with Egypt, giving Carthage sea-bourne access to the Eastern markets, which were cut-off since 480 BC.

===Third Sicilian War (315 BC?307 BC) ===
In [[315 BC]], [[Agathocles]], the tyrant of Syracuse and considered as one of the Diadochi, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina). In [[311 BC]] he invaded the Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]]. [[Hamilcar]], grandson of Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XIX, p106-110&lt;/ref&gt; led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By [[310 BC]], he controlled almost all of Sicily and had blockaded Syracuse itself.

In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. The expedition ravaged Carthaginian possessions in Africa. Troops recalled from Sicily under the joint command of Hanno and Bomilcar (two political rivals) were defeated by Agathocles, Hanno himself falling in battle. Ophellas, one of the Diadochi, came from Cyrene with 10,000 troops to aid the Syracusans. Agathocles eventually murdered Ophellas and took over his army. Although the Greeks eventually managed to capture Utica, Carthage continued to resist, and Syracuse remained blockaded.

In Sicily, Hamilcar led a night attack on Syracuse, which failed, leading to his capture and subsequent execution by the Syracusans. Agathocles returned to Syracuse in 308 BC and defeated the Punic army, thus lifting the blockade, then returned to Africa. In 307, the war came to an end when Carthage finally managed to defeat the Greeks in Africa, after surviving a coup attempt by Bomilcar. Agathocles abandoned his army and returned to Syracuse, where a treaty divided Sicily between Punic and Greek domains.

===Treaty with Rome===
Carthage and Rome signed another treaty in 306 BC, according to the Greek historian [[Philinus of Agrigentum|Philinus]]. The main feature of this treaty is the agreement by Rome not to interfere in Sicily and Carthage not to exert influence over events in Italy. The historian Polybius considers this treaty a forgery.

===Pyrrhic War===
{{main|Pyrrhic War}}
Between [[280 BC|280]] and [[275 BC]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in an effort to protect and extend the influence of the Macedonians in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.

The Greek city of Tarentum had attacked and sacked the city of [[Thruii]] and expelled the newly installed Roman garrison in 282 BC. Committed to war, they appealed to Pyrrhus, who ultimately arrived with an army and defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] and the [[Battle of Asculum]]. In the midst of Pyrrhus' Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of [[Agrigentum]], [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Leontini]], asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:1?22:3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage had attacked Syracuse and besieged the city after seizing Akragus. Mago, the Carthaginian admiral, had 100 ships blockading the city. Pyrrhus agreed to intervene, and sailed for Sicily. Mago lifted the siege and Pyrrhus fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]] and 20 war elephants, supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus' Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of [[Erice|Eryx]], even though he was not able to capture [[Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:4?22:6]&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-month siege, Pyrrhus withdrew.

Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to [[Plutarch]], Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. The Carthaginians fought a battle outside Lilybaeum in 276 BC, and lost.

The ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and the execution of two Sicilian rulers whom Pyrrhus claimed were plotting against him, led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet of Pyhrrus was defeated by Carthage, the Greeks losing 70 ships in the battle.

Pyrrhus' campaigns in Italy were futile, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its &quot;[[sphere of influence]]&quot;, bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].

==The Punic Wars==
{{further2|[[Punic Wars]]|[[First Punic War]]|[[Mercenary War]]|[[Second Punic War]]|[[Third Punic War]]}}

When Agathocles died in [[288 BC]], a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or &quot;sons of Mars&quot;), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In [[265 BC]], [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. As a result, embassies were sent to both cities.

While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests. The Roman senate was unable to decide on a course of action and referred the matter to the people, who voted to intervene.

The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]]. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], which nearly prevented the rise of the Roman Empire. Eventual victory by Rome was a turning point which meant that the civilization of the ancient Mediterranean would pass to the modern world via Southern Europe instead of North Africa.

Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]] which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the [[Barcid]] family to prominence), and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]].

==The fall of Carthage==
The fall of Carthage was at the end of the third Punic War in [[146 BC]]. In spite of the initial devastating Roman naval losses at the beginning of the series of conflicts and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by Hannibal, the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, slaughtering and enslaving the people. The city was set ablaze, and in this way was razed with only ruins and rubble to field the aftermath.

==Roman Carthage==
Since the 19th century, some historians have written that the city of Carthage was [[salting the earth|salted]] to ensure that no crops could be grown there, but there is no ancient evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, R.T., &quot;To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' vol. 81, no. 2  (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Follis-Domitius Alexander-carthage RIC 68.jpg|thumb|[[Domitius Alexander]] on a [[follis]]. On the reverse, the personification of Carthage, his capital.]]

When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the Lake of Tunis and the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt was accumulated in the harbor until it was made useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

A new city of Carthage was built on the same land, and by the 1st century AD it had grown to the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman empire]], with a peak population of 500,000. It was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the empire. Carthage briefly became the capital of an usurper, [[Domitius Alexander]], in [[308]]&amp;ndash;[[311]] [[Anno Domini|AD]].

Carthage also became a center of early [[Christianity]]. [[Tertullian]] rhetorically addressed the Roman governor with the fact that the Christians of Carthage that just yesterday were few in number, now &quot;have filled every place among you ?cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods.&quot; (''[[Apologeticus]]'' written at Carthage, c. [[197]]). It is worth noting that Tertullian omits any mention of the surrounding countryside or its network of villas not unlike colonial [[hacienda]] society.

[[Image:Roman-Villas-Carthage.jpg|thumb|Roman villas, Carthage]]

In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In [[397]] at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Biblical canon]] for the western Church was confirmed.

[[Image:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Antonine baths ruins, from the Roman period]]

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centers were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the Byzantines finally subdued the Vandals in the 6th century. Using Gaiseric's grandson's deposal by a distant cousin, [[Gelimer]], as a pretext, the Byzantines dispatched an army to conquer the Vandal kingdom. On Sunday, October 15, 533, the Byzantine general [[Belisarius]], accompanied by his wife [[Antonina]], made his formal entry into Carthage, sparing it a sack and a [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]].

During the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, Carthage was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in Italy. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage [[Heraclius]], who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

The Byzantine Exarchate was not, however, able to withstand the [[Arab]] conquerors of the 7th century. The first Arab assault on the Exarchate of Carthage was initiated from [[Egypt]] without much success in [[647]]. A more protracted campaign lasted from [[670]] to [[683]]. In [[698]], the [[Exarchate of Africa]] was finally overrun by  [[Hassan Ibn al Numan]] and a force of 40,000 men, who destroyed Roman Carthage, just as the Romans had done in [[146 BC]]. Carthage was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional center. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman or Byzantine influence there, as the rising tide of Islam shattered the empire.

It is currently a suburb of [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], with a population of 20,715 (2004 Census).

The first civilization that developed within the city's sphere of influence is referred to as Punic (a form of the word &quot;Phoenician&quot;) or Carthaginian. The city of Carthage is located on the eastern side of [[Lake Tunis]] across from the centre of Tunis. According to Greek historians it was founded by [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from Tyre under the leadership of Elissa who was renamed ([[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]]) in Virgil's [[Aeneid]]. It became a large and rich city and thus a major power in the Mediterranean. The resulting rivalry with [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Numidia]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] was accompanied by several wars with respective invasions of each other's homeland.

[[Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy in the [[Second Punic War]] culminated in the Carthaginian [[battle of Cannae|victory at Cannae]] and led to a serious threat to the continuation of Roman rule over Italy; however, Carthage emerged from the conflict weaker after Hannibal's defeat at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202&amp;nbsp;BC. After the [[Third Punic War]], the city was destroyed by the Romans in 146&amp;nbsp;BC. However, the Romans refounded Carthage, which became the Empire's fourth most important city and the capital of the short-lived [[Vandals#The Vandal Kingdom in North Africa|Vandal kingdom]]. It remained one of the most important Roman cities until the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest]] when it was destroyed a second time in AD&amp;nbsp;698.

==Topography==
Carthage was built on a [[promontory]] with inlets to the sea to the north and south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between [[Sicily]] and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence.

[[File:Carthage, Tunisia EO-1.jpg|[[Earth Observing-1|EO-1]] |right|thumb|260px]]
Two large, artificial harbours were built within the city, one for harbouring the city's massive navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbours.

The city had massive walls, 23 miles (37 kilometres) in length, longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were located on the shore and thus could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The 2.5 to 3 miles (4 to 4.8 kilometres) of wall on the [[isthmus]] to the west were truly large and, in fact, were never penetrated.

The city had a huge [[necropolis]] or burial ground, religious area, market places, council house, towers and a theatre and was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. Roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the Byrsa.

Carthage was one of the largest cities in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] times (by some estimates only [[Alexandria]] was larger){{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and was among the largest cities in pre-industrial history.

Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]], very few Carthaginian [[primary source|primary historical sources]] survive.

H. ''Carthage'', p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation legends===
====Queen Elissa (Dido)====
[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Carthage]]
According to Roman sources, [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from modern-day [[Lebanon]], led by Queen Dido (Elissa) founded Carthage. [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Elissa]] (also known as &quot;Alissar&quot;), was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At its peak,  the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the &quot;shining city,&quot; ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean and leading the Phoenician (or Punic) world.

Elissa's brother, King [[Pygmalion of Tyre]], had murdered her husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the &quot;new city&quot; of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Matten of Tyre (also known as Muttoial or Belus II). When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, Pygmalion. She married her uncle Acherbas (also known as Sychaeus), the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between [[religion and politics|religion and the monarchy]]. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign, causing dissent within the royal family.

====The mention of Queen Elissa (Dido) in Virgil's Aeneid====
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] epic of [[Virgil]], the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]], the Greek name for Queen Elissa, is first introduced as an extremely respected character. In just seven years, since their exodus from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who have recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: &quot;rise up from my bones, avenging spirit&quot; (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of [[Hannibal]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian Republic===
{{Main|Carthaginian Republic}}
[[File:CarthageMap.png|thumb|Carthaginian held territory in the early 3rd century BC]]
The Carthaginian Republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and finally, Rome, which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the third Punic war.

====Army====
{{Main|Military of ancient Carthage}}
According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries,&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Book 6, 52. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234&amp;query=head%3D%23524 On the ''Perseus'' project] &lt;blockquote&gt;
The former (the Romans - editor's note) bestow their whole attention upon this department (upon military service on land - editor's note): whereas the Carthaginians wholly neglect their infantry, though they do take some slight interest in the cavalry. The reason of this is that they employ foreign mercenaries, the Romans native and citizen levies. It is in this point that the latter polity is preferable to the former. They have their hopes of freedom ever resting on the courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour of their own citizens and the aid of their allies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; especially in overseas warfare. The core of its army was from its own territory in north Africa (ethnic [[Libyans]] and [[Numidians]], as well as &quot;Liby-Phoenicians&quot; ? i.e. Phoenicians proper). These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean who fought in their own national units; [[Celt]]ic, [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]], and [[Iberians|Iberian]] troops were especially common. Later, after the Barcid conquest of Iberia, Iberians came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces. Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its north African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of Numidian contingents of [[Numidian cavalry|light cavalry]]. Other mounted troops included the now extinct [[North African elephant]]s, trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anti-cavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants in case they charged toward their own army.

====Navy====
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|Roman [[trireme]] mosaic from Carthage, [[Bardo Museum]], Tunis ]]
The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the [[Mediterranean]], using [[serial production]] to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and [[marine (military)|marines]] of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the [[Punic]] citizenry, unlike the multi-ethnic allied and [[mercenary]] troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy - The Fall of Carthage&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that there was in peacetime a training of oarsmen and coxswains, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.

The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the Sahara and especially by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic to the tin-rich islands of Britain and to West Africa. There is evidence that at least one Punic expedition under [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]] sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], describing how the sun was in the north at noon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[Polybius]] wrote in the sixth book of his History that the Carthaginians were &quot;more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, History Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the [[First Punic War]], managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse engineering captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced [[Greeks|Greek]] sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the [[Third Punic War]] Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the superior Roman numbers for a whole day.

====Fall====
[[File:Tunisie Carthage Ruines 08.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Carthage]]
The fall of Carthage came at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC at the [[Battle of Carthage (c.149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wine: The 8,000-Year-Old Story of the Wine Trade'', Thomas Pellechia (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by [[Hannibal]], the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing, raping and enslaving the people. Fifty thousand Carthaginians were sold into [[slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001198.html Ancient History]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was set ablaze, and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as [[Volubilis]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], [[Chellah]], and [[Mogador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C.

===A city of survivors===
====Byrsa====

{{Main|Byrsa}}

[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|District of Punic Byrsa]]

On top of [[Byrsa]] hill, the location of the [[Forum (Roman)|Roman Forum]], a residential area from the last century of existence (early 2nd century) of the Punic city was excavated by the French archaeologist Serge Lancel. The neighborhood, with its houses, shops and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life there over twenty-one hundred years ago. .&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel and Jean-Paul Morel, &quot;Byrsa. Punic vestiges&quot;; ''To save Carthage. Exploration and conservation of the city Punic, Roman and Byzantine'', Unesco / INAA, 1992, pp. 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The habitat is typical, even stereotypical.  The street was often used as a storefront; cistern tanks were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a [[sump]], around which various other elements may be found. In some places the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.

The remains have been preserved under embankments, the [[substructures]] of the later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets approximately six metres wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; there are ''in situ'' stairs to compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, &quot;Hannibal district&quot;, referring to the Punic general or [[Suffete]]  at the beginning of the 2nd century BC.

===Roman Carthage===

[[File:Karta Karthago.PNG|thumb|Roman Carthage]]
When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the Lake of Tunis and the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt was accumulated in the harbor until it was made useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

By 122 BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] founded a short-lived [[Colonia (Roman)|''colonia'']], called [[Colonia Junonia|''Colonia Iunonia'']], after the Latin name for the punic goddess [[Tanit]], ''Iuno caelestis''. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] abolished the colony some time later, in order to undermine Gracchus' power.

After this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49-44 BC period, and by the 1st century it had grown to be the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman Empire]], with a peak population of 500,000{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. It was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major breadbasket of the Empire.

Carthage also became a [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|centre of early Christianity]]. In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than seventy bishops attended. [[Tertullian]] later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|bishop of Rome]], but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed]].

[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|Vandal Empire in 500 AD, centered in Carthage.]]

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centres were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] finally [[Vandalic War|subdued the Vandals]] in 533-534.

Thereafter the city became the seat of the [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]], which during the Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in [[Italy]]. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage, who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

===Islamic Carthage===

The [[Exarchate of Africa]] was not able to withstand the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim]] conquerors of the 7th century. [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 686 AD sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qais who won a battle over Byzantines and [[Berber people|Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila]], on the [[Qairawan]] plain, but could not follow that up. In 695 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured Carthage and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. A [[Byzantine]] fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] returned and defeated [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. The Byzantines withdrew from all of Africa except [[Ceuta]]. Roman Carthage was destroyed, just as the Romans had destroyed the Carthaginian Republic in 146 BC. Carthage was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional centre. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman/Byzantine influence there.

==Modern times==
Carthage remains a popular [[tourist]] attraction and residential [[suburb]] of [[Tunis]]. The Tunisian presidential palace is located in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=648961&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=200|agency=philSTAR.com|title=More Tunisia unrest: Presidential palace gunbattle |date=17 January 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1985,  [[Ugo Vetere]], the mayor of [[Rome]], and Chedly Klibi, the mayor of Carthage, signed a symbolic treaty &quot;officially&quot; ending the conflict between their cities, which had been supposedly [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]] for more than 2,100 years.&lt;ref&gt;

== Carthage in fiction ==
Carthage features in Gustave Flaubert's historical novel ''[[Salammb? (novel)|Salammb?]]'' (1862). Set around the time of the Mercenaries' War, it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

In ''[[The Dead Past]]'', a science fiction short story by [[Isaac Asimov]], a leading character is an ancient historian who is trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice.

In [[Kushiel's Mercy]] by [[Jacqueline Carey]], Carthage is a conquering nation that is geographically and culturally based on the historical Carthage.

''The Purple Quest'' by [[Frank G. Slaughter]] is about the founding of Carthage.

The TV Series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'' and  ''[[Spartacus: Gods of the Arena]]'', which are set in ancient Rome, feature a gladiator named Barca who is also known as &quot;The Beast of Carthage&quot; and was present at its fall.

Temple of Antas

<text>
[[File:Tempio di Antas.jpg|thumb|220px|The Temple of Antas.]]The '''Temple of Antas''' is an ancient [[Carthaginian]]-[[Roman architecture|Roman]] temple in the commune of [[Fluminimaggiore]], southern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. It is located in an area colonized by the Carthaginians and then by the Romans, attracted by its  iron and lead deposits.
It consists of a Roman temple, under whose steps are the remains of the Carthaginian one, which was dedicated to the god ''Sid Addir'', a later incarnation of the local god ''[[Sardus|Sardus Pater Babai]]'', the main male divinity of the [[Nuragic civilization]].

The original temple had been built around 500 BC over a sacred limestone [[outcrop]], and restored around 300 BC. The Roman temple was built by emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BC - 14 AD) and restored under [[Caracalla]] (213-217 AD). Its remains were discovered in 1836 by general [[Alberto La Marmora]], and rebuilt to the current status in 1967.

The fore section of the temple includes six columns, with a height of some 8 meters, with [[Ionic columns|Ionic capitals]]. Originally a triangular [[pediment]] was also present. The [[cella]] was accessed through two side openings and had a mosaic-covered pavement, part of which has been preserved. The temple was provided with two square reservoirs, which housed the water for the sacred rites of purification.

It is likely that a statue of the Sardus Pater was housed in the cella. According to the size of the only remain found, a finger, it has been estimated that it was some 3 meters high.

The archaeological area of temple includes a small [[necropolis]], remains of an ancient Nuragic village (13th-10th centuries BC), Roman quarries of limestone and an ancient path connecting the temple to a sacred cave where the water cult was practiced.

Tertullian

</id>
<text>
[[File:Tertullian.jpg|thumb|A woodcut illustration depicting Tertullian]]'''Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus''', [[anglicised]] as '''Tertullian''' (c. 160 ? c. 225 AD),&lt;ref&gt;T.D.Barnes, ''Tertullian: a literary and historical study'Oxford, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; was a prolific early Christian author from [[Carthage]] in the Roman province of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;T. D. Barnes, ''Tertullian: a Historical and Literary Study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of [[Latin]] Christian literature. He also was a notable early [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] and a polemicist against [[heresy]]. Tertullian has been called &quot;the father of [[Latin Christianity]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the founder of Western theology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot;&gt;Justo L. Gonz?les, ''The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation'' (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2010), 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though conservative, he did originate and advance new theology to the early Church. He is perhaps most famous for being the oldest extant Latin writer to use the term '''Trinity''' (Latin '''trinitas'''),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trinitas&quot; is itself a Latinization of the Greek &quot;he trias&quot; (the Triad), a term that was used earlier than Tertullian by [[Theophilus of Antioch]] in ''Ad Autolycum'' 2.15 to refer to God, God's Logos (Jesus), and God's Sophia (Holy Spirit)&lt;/ref&gt; and giving the oldest extant formal exposition of a Trinitarian theology.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Adversus Praxean''; see Barnes for a summary of the work.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Latin formulations that first appear in his work are &quot;three Persons, one Substance&quot; as the Latin &quot;tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]&quot; (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] &quot;treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostases]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt; He wrote his trinitarian formula after becoming a [[Montanist]]; his ideas were at first rejected as heresy by the church at large, but later accepted as Christian orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt;

== Life ==
Scant reliable evidence exists to inform us about Tertullian's life. Most history about him comes from passing references in his own writings.

According to church tradition, he was raised in [[Carthage]]&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought to be the son of a Roman centurion, a trained lawyer, and an ordained priest. These assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', II, ii. 4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (On famous men) chapter 53.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction to [[Timothy Barnes]], 'Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study; however Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of 'centurio proconsularis' (&quot;aide-de-camp&quot;) in the [[Roman army]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], 'Chronicon' 16.23-4&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether any such position in the Roman military ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Timothy. 'Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1971, pg. 11 [http://books.google.com/books?id=eH-BNqfc8iMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tertullian:+A+Historical+and+Literary+Study&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=it#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20title%20centurio%20proconsularis&amp;f=true Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Tertullian has been thought to be a lawyer based on his use of legal analogies and an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''. Although Tertullian utilized a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed that of what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 24,27&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same [[cognomen]], exist only in fragments and do not denote a Christian authorship. (Tertullianus was mis-identified only much later with the Christian Tertullian by church historians.)&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, any notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in the church and seems to place himself among the laity.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7.3 and De Monogamia 12.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Africa was famous as the home of orators. This influence can be seen in his style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper. He was a scholar with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in Greek. In them he refers to himself, but none of these are extant. His principal study was jurisprudence and his methods of reasoning reveal striking marks of his juridical training. He shone among the advocates of Rome, as Eusebius reports.

His conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197?198 (cf. [[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He said of himself that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: &quot;Christians are made, not born&quot; (''Apol'', xviii).

Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.

In middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the &quot;New Prophecy&quot; of [[Montanism]], and seems to have split from the mainstream church. In the time of Augustine, a group of &quot;Tertullianists&quot; still had a basilica in Carthage which, within that same period, passed to the orthodox Church. It is unclear whether the name was merely another for the Montanists&lt;ref&gt;The passage in ''Praedestinatus'' describing the Tertullianists suggests that this might have been the case, as the Tertullianist minister obtains the use of a church in Rome on the grounds that the martyrs to whom it was dedicated were Montanists. But the passage is very condensed and ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; or that this means Tertullian later split with the Montanists and founded his own group.

Jerome&lt;ref&gt;''De viris illustribus'' 53&lt;/ref&gt; says that Tertullian lived to a great age, but there is no reliable source attesting to his survival beyond the estimated year 225 AD. In spite of his schism from the Church, he continued to write against heresy, especially [[Gnosticism]]. Thus, by the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who, in turn, became the chief founder of Latin theology.

== Writings ==
=== General character ===
Thirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged [[Codex Agobardinus]] in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time ? apologetics against paganism and Judaism, polemics, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of the greatest interest to the church historian.

=== Chronology and contents ===
The chronology of these writings is difficult to fix with certainty. It is in part determined by the [[Montanism|Montanistic]] views that are set forth in some of them, by the author's own allusions to ''this'' writing, or ''that,'' as antedating others (cf. Harnack, ''Litteratur'' ii.260?262), and by definite historic data (e.g., the reference to the death of [[Septimius Severus]], ''Ad Scapulam'', iv). In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv. Marcionem'', i.1, 15) --which would be approximately the year 208.

The writings may be divided with reference to the two periods of Tertullian's Christian activity, the Catholic and the Montanist (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), or according to their subject-matter. The object of the former mode of division is to show, if possible, the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent. Following the latter mode, which is of a more practical interest, the writings fall into two groups. Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', ''Adv. Judaeos'', ''Adv. Marcionem'', ''Adv. Praxeam'', ''Adv. Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''.

Among his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus,'' addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demands a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.

Tertullian was the first to break the force of such charges as that the Christians sacrificed infants at the celebration of the Lord's Supper and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced also the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors. They do better: they pray for them. Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; &quot;the blood of the [[martyr]]s is seed&quot; (''Apologeticum'', 50). In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.

The five books against Marcion, written 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Of the moral and ascetic treatises, the ''De patientia'' and ''[[De spectaculis]]'' are among the most interesting, and the ''De pudicitia'' and ''De virginibus velandis'' among the most characteristic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Theology ==
=== General character ===
Though thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian was independent of its metaphysical speculation. He had learned from the Greek apologies, and forms a direct contrast to [[Origen of Alexandria]], who drew much of his theories regarding creation from middle platonism. Tertullian, the prince of realists and practical theologian, carried his [[philosophical realism|realism]] to the verge of materialism. This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the traducian theory of the origin of the soul. He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (''De anima'', iii.). He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that [[Socrates]] in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to [[Aesculapius]] (''De anima'', i). Tertullian always wrote under stress of a felt necessity. He was never so happy as when he had opponents like [[Marcion]] and [[Praxeas]], and, however abstract the ideas may be which he treated, he was always moved by practical considerations to make his case clear and irresistible. It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day. He was a born disputant. It is true that during the 3rd century no mention is made of his name by other authors. Lactantius at the opening of the 4th century is the first to do this, but Augustine treats him openly with respect. Cyprian, Tertullian's North African compatriot, though he nowhere mentions his name, was well read in his writings, as Cyprian's secretary told Jerome.

=== Specific teachings ===
Tertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:
# The soul was not preexistent, as Plato affirmed, nor subject to [[metempsychosis]] or [[reincarnation]], as the [[Pythagoreans]] held. In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (''De anima'', xxvii). This position is called [[traducianism]] in opposition to '[[Creationism (soul)|creationism]]', or the idea that each soul is a fresh creation of God. For Tertullian the soul is, however, a distinct entity and a certain corporeity and as such it may be tormented in Hell (''De anima'', lviii).
# The soul's sinfulness is easily explained by its [[traducian]] origin (''De anima'', xxxix). It is in bondage to [[Satan]] (whose works it renounces in baptism), but has seeds of good (''De anima'', xli), and when awakened, it passes to health and at once calls upon God (''Apol.'', xvii.) and is naturally Christian. It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian's Scriptures (''De testimonio,'' v-vi).
# God, who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (''De praescriptione'', vii.; ''Adv. Praxeam,'' vii.). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the stoic sense, to mean something with actual existence, rather than the later idea of flesh. In the statement of the Trinity, Tertullian was a forerunner of the Nicene doctrine, approaching the subject from the standpoint of the Logos doctrine, though he did not state the immanent Trinity. His use of ''trinitas'' (Latin: 'Threeness') emphasised the manifold character of God. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words, &quot; Trinity and economy, persons and substance.&quot; The Son is distinct from the Father, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (''Adv. Praxeam,'' xxv).  &quot;These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.&quot; The very names &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is one, and the Spirit is one (''Adv. Praxeam'', ix). As regards the question whether the Son was coeternal with the Father, many believe that Tertullian did not teach that. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, &quot;There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm &quot;Tertullian,&quot; ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] in ''Princeton Theological Review'', 1906, pp. 56, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[J.N.D. Kelly]] has stated: &quot;Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His ?perfect generation? from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term ?Father?, which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father and Son.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines,'' Continual International Publishing Book, c1960, 2000, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: &quot;In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian?s views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of Arianism the Church rejected as heretical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W. Le Saint, &quot;Tertullian,&quot; ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia,'' Thompson Gale, 2003, Vol. 13, p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In [[soteriology]], Tertullian does not dogmatize; he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (''De Patientia'', iii). The sufferings of Christ's life as well as of the crucifixion are efficacious to redemption. In the water of [[baptism]], which (upon a partial quotation of John 3:5) is made necessary (''De baptismo'', vi.), humans are born again; the baptized does not receive the [[Holy Spirit]] in the water, but is prepared for the Holy Spirit. Humans are little fishes&amp;mdash;after the example of the ''[[ichthys]]'', fish, Jesus Christ&amp;mdash;are born in water (''De baptismo'', i). In discussing whether sins committed subsequent to baptism may be forgiven, Tertullian calls baptism and [[penance]] &quot;two planks&quot; on which the sinner may be saved from shipwreck ? language which he gave to the Church (''De penitentia'', xii).
# With reference to the 'rule of faith', it may be said that Tertullian is constantly using this expression, and by it means ''now'' the authoritative tradition handed down in the Church, ''now'' the Scriptures themselves, and, ''perhaps'', a definite doctrinal formula. While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the ''instrumentum '' and ''testamentum'' (''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1). He distinguishes between the four Gospels and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (''De praescriptione'', xxxvi; ''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1?5); in trying to account for Marcion's treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the &quot;shipmaster from Pontus&quot; (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (''Adv. Marcionem'', v.1). The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (''De corona'', iii-iv). As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (''De testimonio animae'', vi). They contain all truth (''De praescriptione'', vii, xiv) and from them the Church drinks (''potat'') her faith (''Adv. Praxeam'', xiii). The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (''Apol.'', xix-xx). The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, insofar as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies. &quot;What has [[Athens]] to do with [[Jerusalem]]?&quot; he exclaims, &quot;or the Academy with the Church?&quot;  (''De praescriptione'', vii). Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (''De anima'', i); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven. However, Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of [[Stoicism]] to discuss a problem (''De anima''). The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (''De praescriptione'', xiii).
#Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men, ? a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter. In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed.&quot;
# [[Fornication|Fornicators]] and [[Murder]]ers should never be admitted into the church under any circumstances. In ''de pudicitia'', Tertullian condemns Pope [[Callixtus I]] for allowing such people in when they show repentance.

== Moral principles ==
Tertullian was a determined advocate of strict discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. These views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views.

On the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments (''De cultu'', v-vi), and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis''). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i.3), called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by Vestal Virgins and Egyptian priests, and he pronounced second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortations castitatis'', ix).

Tertullian has been accused of going to an unhealthy extreme in his counsels of asceticism; for example, about [[ejaculation|ejaculatory]] [[orgasm]]s he wrote:
:''In that last breaking wave of delight, do we not feel something of our very soul go out from us?''&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''de anima'', 27:5&lt;/ref&gt;

His moral vigour and the service he provided as an ingenious and intrepid defender of the Christian religion were, for him, down to his view of Christianity as first and chiefly an experience of the heart.

Because of his later affiliation with Montanism, he, like the influential Alexandrian theologian, [[Origen of Alexandria|Origen]], has failed to receive the elevation of official [[canonization]].

Tertullian is sometimes criticized for being [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his 'De Cultu Feminarum,' section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx): &quot;Do you not know that you are Eve? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. You are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, Adam. Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die.?

Tertullian wrote in his book ''On Patience'' 5:15 &quot;Having been made pregnant by the seed of the devil ... she brought forth a son.&quot; Or, in a different translation, &quot;For straightway that impatience conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts.&quot;

=== Spurious Works ===

There have been many works attributed to Tertullian in the past which have since been determined to be almost definitely written by others. Nonetheless, since their actual authors remain uncertain, they continue to be published together in collections of Tertullian's works.

*1. ''Adversus Omnes Haereses'' (Against all Heresies) - poss. [[Victorinus of Pettau]]
*2 ''De execrandis gentium diis''  (On the Execrable Gods of the Heathens)
*3 ''Carmen adversus Marcionem'' (Poem against Marcion)
*4 ''Carmen de Iona Propheta'' (Poem about the Prophet Jonas) - poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
*5 ''Carmen de Sodoma'' (Poem about Sodom) - poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
*6 ''Carmen de Genesi'' (Poem about Genesis)
*7 ''Carmen de Judicio Domini'' (Poem about the Judgment of the Lord)

The popular ''Passio SS. Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' (Martyrdom of SS. Perpetua and Felicitas), much of it the personal diary of St. [[Perpetua]], was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer held, and it is usually published separately from Tertullian's works.

[[Image:Alfons Mucha - 1896 - Salammb?.jpg|thumb|Salammb? by [[Alfons Mucha]] (1896)]]
'''''Salammb?''''' (1862) is a [[historical novel]] by [[Gustave Flaubert]].  It is set in [[Carthage]] during the [[3rd century BC|third century BCE]], immediately before and during the [[Mercenary Revolt (Carthage)|Mercenary Revolt]] which took place shortly after the [[First Punic War]]. Flaubert's main source was Book I of [[Polybius]]'s ''Histories''. It was not a particularly well-studied period of history and required a great deal of work from the author, who enthusiastically left behind the [[Literary realism|realism]] of his masterpiece ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' for this tale of blood-and-thunder.

The book, which Flaubert researched painstakingly, is largely an exercise in sensuous and violent exoticism. Following the success of ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', it was another best-seller and sealed his reputation. The Carthaginian costumes described in it even left traces on the fashions of the time. Nevertheless, in spite of its classic status in France, it is not widely known today among English speakers.

==Plot==

After the [[First Punic War]], Carthage is unable to fulfil promises made to its army of mercenaries, and finds itself under attack. The fictional title character, a priestess and the daughter of [[Hamilcar Barca]], an aristocratic Carthaginian general, is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. With the help of the scheming freed slave, Spendius, Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Za?mph, prompting Salammb? to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back.  The Za?mph is an ornate bejewelled veil draped about the statue of the goddess [[Tanit]] in the sanctum sanctorum of her temple: the veil is the city's guardian and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.

*'''Chapter 1.''' ''The Feast.'' During a victory banquet, the mercenaries destroy Hamilcar's garden for sport in his absence. Hamilcar's daughter Salammb? tries to quell the riot. Matho falls in love with her. The slave Spendius is released, and he tries to persuade Matho to take Carthage for the mercenaries.
*'''Chapter 2.''' ''At Sicca.'' The mercenaries leave the city unpaid and travel to Sicca. Later, Hanno comes and speaks to the mercenaries about delays in recompensing them, but he is driven off when Zarxas arrives and tells them of a treacherous massacre of 300 slingers who had stayed behind.
*'''Chapter 3.''' ''Salammb?.'' Hamilcar's daughter prays and is instructed by Schahabarim.
*'''Chapter 4.''' ''Beneath the Walls of Carthage.'' The mercenaries besiege Carthage; Matho and Spendius penetrate via the aqueduct.
*'''Chapter 5.''' ''Tanit.'' Matho and Spendius steal the Za?mph. Because Matho is caught while breaking into Salammb?'s bedroom to see her again, she falls under suspicion of complicity.
*'''Chapter 6.''' ''Hanno.'' The mercenaries leave Carthage and split into two groups, attacking Utica and Hippo-Zarytus. Hanno surprises Spendius at Utica, and occupies the city, but flees when Matho arrives and routs his troops.
*'''Chapter 7.''' ''Hamilcar Barca.'' The hero returns and an attempt is made to blame him for Hanno's losses. He defends himself before the Council and defends the mercenaries, but turns against the barbarians when he sees the damage they have done to his property.
*'''Chapter 8.''' ''The Battle of the Macar.'' Hamilcar defeats Spendius at the bridge of the Macar, three miles from Utica.
*'''Chapter 9.''' ''In the Field.'' Hamilcar's troops are trapped by the mercenaries.
*'''Chapter 10.''' ''The Serpent.'' Schahabarim sends Salammb? in disguise to retrieve the Za?mph.
*'''Chapter 11.''' ''In the Tent.'' Salammb? reaches Matho in his tent at the encampment. Believing each other to be divine apparitions, they make love. The mercenaries are attacked and dispersed by Hamilcar's troops. She takes away the Za?mph, and on meeting her father, Hamilcar has her betrothed to Narr' Havas, a mercenary who has changed sides.
*'''Chapter 12.''' ''The Aqueduct.'' The Carthaginians return to their city with the mercenaries in pursuit. Spendius cuts off the water supply to Carthage.
*'''Chapter 13.''' ''Moloch.'' Carthaginian children are sacrificed to Moloch. Hamilcar disguises a slave-child as his son Hannibal and sends him to die in his son's place.
*'''Chapter 14.''' ''The Defile of the Axe.'' The drought is broken and aid comes. Hamilcar drives the mercenaries away from their encampments. Later, thousands of mercenaries are trapped in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] and slowly starve (the [[Battle of &quot;The Saw&quot;]]). Deaths of Hanno and Spendius, both by crucifixion.
*'''Chapter 15.''' ''Matho.'' Victory celebrations at Carthage. Matho is tortured before his execution; Salammb?, witnessing this, dies of shock.  The Za?mph has brought death upon those who touched it.

==Characters==
The transliterations follow J. W. Matthews's English version.
*Abdalonim, the overseer of Hamilcar's stewards
*[[Autaritus|Autharitus]] (Autharite), a leader of the Mercenaries
*Demonades, a servant of Hanno
*Giddenem, the governor of Hamilcar's slaves
*[[Hasdrubal Gisco|Gisco (Gesco)]], a Carthaginian general
*[[Hamilcar Barca|'''Hamilcar''' Barca (Amilcar)]], Carthaginian general who led the mercenaries before the events of the book
*[[Hannibal]], Hamilcar's young son
*'''Hanno''' (Hannon), a Carthaginian general (based on [[Hanno the Great]] and [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal of the Mercenary War]])
*Iddibal, a servant of Hamilcar
*'''Matho''' ([[M?thos]]), a leader of the Mercenaries
*'''Narr' Havas''' (Flaubert's spelling of [[Naravas]]), prince of the Numidians, and a leader of the Mercenaries
*'''Salammb?''', daughter of Hamilcar
*Schahabarim, high priest of Tanith, and teacher of Salammb?
*'''[[Spendius]]''', a slave of Hamilcar, captured at the battle of Argunisae, who becomes a leader of the Mercenaries during the Revolt
*Taanach, a slave attending Salammb?
*Zarxas ([[Zarzas]]), a leader of the Mercenaries

==Quotations==
The opening words became at once almost proverbial: ''C'?tait ? M?gara, faubourg de Carthage, dans les jardins d'Hamilcar...'' ''&quot;It was at Megara, a suburb of Carthage, in the gardens of Hamilcar, that the soldiers whom he had commanded in Sicily were holding a great feast to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Eryx. The master was absent, their numbers were large, and accordingly they ate and drank in perfect freedom.&quot;''

Many readers will remember the chilling passages of chapter 13 (&quot;Moloch&quot;) that describe the burning of the children inside the huge, hollow brass statue of the [[Baal]] [[Moloch]]: ''&quot;The brazen arms were working more quickly. They paused no longer. Every time that a child was placed in them the priests of Moloch spread out their hands upon him to burden him with the crimes of the people, vociferating: &quot;They are not men but oxen!&quot; and the multitude round about repeated: &quot;Oxen! oxen!&quot; The devout exclaimed: &quot;Lord! Eat!&quot;''.

There is also a dramatic account of the boy [[Hannibal]] only narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

Flaubert departs from Polybius's account in many particulars.  In reality [[Hanno]] was not crucified by the mercenaries; there was a Carthaginian general captured and crucified, but his name was [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]], and he felt this would have confused his readers.

Hundred and Four

<text>
The '''Hundred and Four''', or Council of 104, was a [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] tribunal of judges.  They were created early in Carthage's history, and are described in Aristotle's ''Politics'' (4th century BC) as &quot;the highest constitutional authority.&quot;  The Hundred and Four were in charge of judging generals and the military, who exercised a great deal of independence from the government in Carthage.  The Hundred and Four were intended to provide a check to insure the military served the needs of the senate and the people. However, by the time of [[Hannibal Barca]], and his stint as [[Suffet]] (early 2nd century BC), the 104 had acquired tyrannical power.{{quote |
?By the old constitution, the Senate had the right to control the magistrates; but this new body of judges controlled the Senate, and therefore, in reality, the magistrates also.  Nor was it content to control the Senate; it practically superseded it...  No Shofete, no Senator, no general, was exempt from their irresponsible despotism.  The Shofetes presided, the senators deliberated, the generals fought, as it were, with a halter around their necks.  The sentences passed by the Hundred, if they were often deserved, were often also, like those of the dreaded [[Council of Ten|?Ten? at Venice]], to whom they bore a striking resemblance, arbitrary and cruel.?&lt;ref&gt;R. Bosworth Smith, ''Carthage and the Carthaginians'' (Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., 1913), p. 24  CF. [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 19.2.5; [[Aristotle]], ''The Politics'' 2.11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By leading a populist reform movement?including substituting annual rotation in office for the life tenure formerly enjoyed by the 104?Hannibal managed to restore a measure of popular rule.  Until [[Hannibal]]'s reforms the Hundred and Four held their position for life.  During Hannibal's term as [[Shofet|Suffett]] he used popular support to change the term to a year and to add a term limit of two years.&lt;ref&gt;Justin 19.2.5 and Livy 33.46.4; Serge Lancel, ''Carthage: A History'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1995), pp. 114-16, 403; Gilbert &amp; Colette Picard, ''The Life &amp; Death of Carthage'', tr.

The '''Punic language''' or '''Carthagian language''' is an extinct [[Semitic language]] formerly spoken in the Mediterranean region of [[North Africa]] and several [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]], by people of the [[Punic]] or [[Berber people|Berber]] culture.

== Description ==

Punic is an extinct variety of the [[Phoenician language]] spoken in the oversea Phoenician empire in North Africa, including [[Carthage]], and the Mediterranean.  It is known from inscriptions and personal name evidence.  The play ''[[Poenulus]]'' by [[Plautus]] contains a few lines in spoken Punic, which have been subject to some research because, unlike inscriptions, they largely preserve the [[vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Les passages puniques en transcription latine dans le Poenulus de Plaute |last= Sznycer |first= Maurice |year= 1967 |publisher= Librairie C. Klincksieck |location= Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] is generally considered the last major ancient writer to have some knowledge of Punic, and is considered &quot;our primary source on the survival of [late] Punic&quot;. According to him, the Punic language was still spoken in his region (Northern Africa) in the 5th century AD, centuries after the fall of Carthage, and there were still people who called themselves &quot;chanani&quot; ([[Canaan]]ite, i.e: Carthaginian) at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Late Punic Epigraphy |author= Jongeling. Karel; &amp; Kerr, Robert M. |year= 2005 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |isbn= 3161487281 |pages= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing around AD&amp;nbsp;401, he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quae lingua si improbatur abs te, nega Punicis libris, ut a viris doctissimis proditur, multa sapienter esse mandata memoriae. Poeniteat te certe ibi natum, ubi huius linguae cunabula recalent.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And if the Punic language is rejected by you, you virtually deny what has been admitted by most learned men, that many things have been wisely preserved from oblivion in books written in the Punic tongue. Nay, you ought even to be ashamed of having been born in the country in which the cradle of this language is still warm. (Ep. xvii)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea that Punic exerted an influence on the modern [[Maltese language]] was first raised in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Maltese Language Academy | url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 | author=L-Akkademja tal-Malti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been mostly discredited; mainstream theories hold Maltese to be derived from [[Sicilian Arabic|Siculo-Arabic]], with a large number of [[loanwords]] from [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Aspects of Multilingualism in European Language History |last= Vella |first= Alexandra |editor= Kurt Braunm?ller

'''''Hannibal's Children''''' is the 2002 [[alternate history]] [[novel]] by [[John Maddox Roberts]].

==Plot introduction==
The [[Carthaginians]] won the [[Second Punic War]] against the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. The defeated Romans were forced to go into exile north of the [[Danube River]].  Years later a Roman expedition heads south to see what has changed in the world and meets the heirs of [[Hannibal]] who have become kings, or [[Shofet]], of Carthage.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens at the alternate close of the [[Second Punic War]]. Hannibal offers terms to the Romans: abandon your city and move north of the Alps, or be destroyed. The Romans, under the dictator [[Fabius Maximus|Q. Fabius Maximus]], accept the offer and withdraw into [[Germania]], vowing to return. The Carthaginians declare victory and go home.

One chapter and several generations later, the Romans have long since reestablished their republic. These Romans, largely out of need, have adopted a practice of [[Romanization (cultural)|Cultural Romanization]] more pronounced than the historical Romans did: large numbers of Germans have been adopted into the Roman society, forming a large proportion of both the legions and the Senate. A series of auspicious omens prompt the Senate to send a delegation south into Latium. The expedition leaders are subtly but immediately at cross purposes: the commander, Marcus Scipio, a scion of the ancient patrician [[Scipio (cognomen)|Cornelii Scipiones]] family, is wholly motivated by a desire to reestablish the Republic in the Mediterranean basin. His deputy, Titus Norbanus, one of the newer, Germanic Romans, seeks personal glory, at least in part to ensure that the Germans (particularly his own family) remain as powerful within the expanded Republic as they do under the current scheme. It quickly becomes clear to the Romans that generations of constant warfare in Germania have strengthened them, whereas the Carthaginians have grown soft in the absence of real opposition. The Republic quickly begins playing the Carthaginians off against the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egyptians]] (the only other serious power in the Mediterranean), reclaiming Latium in the process. At the close of the novel, the Egyptian army led by Scipio vanquishes the Carthaginian force, in which four Roman legions led by Norbanus are technically serving. The sequel follows Norbanus's trek back to friendly territory and his march towards power.

==Characters in ''Hannibal's Children''==
;Marcus Scipio: Leader of Roman Expedition to Carthage and Egypt
;Titus Norbanus: Second in command of Roman Expedition
;Selene: Queen of Egypt
;Hamilcar: Shofet of Carthage

==Major themes==
As with Roberts's [[SPQR series|other series]], ''Hannibal's Children'' and its sequel ''[[The Seven Hills]]'' explore the decline of the Republic in the face of ambition. In the former, the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] and in the latter Norbanus aggressively pursue power for its own sake, in the process exposing weaknesses in the Republic.

{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}}'''Empress Bo''' ({{zh|c=???|p=B? Hu?ngh?u}}) (personal name unknown) (died 147 BC) was an [[empress#China|empress]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].  She was the first wife of [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]].
Empress Bo was from the family of [[Empress Dowager Bo]], who was probably her paternal grandaunt and betrothed her to her grandson, then-Crown Prince Qi during the reign of her son, [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]]. She carried the title of crown princess during the reign of her father-in-law. Then, when her husband became emperor in 157 BC, she was created empress, but she was not favored by her husband, and she had no sons. It was as a consequence of this that [[Consort Li (Jing)|Consort Li]]'s son [[Liu Rong]] was made crown prince.

After Grand Empress Dowager Bo died in 155 BC, Empress Bo lost her source of support within the palace.  In 151 BC, her husband deposed her.  She died four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lily Xiao Hong Lee, A. D.

==History==
The origin of French nationalism and French patriotism is viewed to have begun with [[Joan of Arc]] who fought for France and always addressed her supporters as &quot;Frenchmen&quot;.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} French nationalism rose as a movement after the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] promoted French nationalism based upon the ideals of the French Revolution such as the ideal of &quot;[[liberty, equality, fraternity]]&quot; and justified French expansionism and French military campaigns on the claim that France had the right to spread the enlightened ideals of the French Revolution across Europe.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} Napoleon's invasions of other nations had the effect of spreading the concept of nationalism outside of France.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}}

After Napoleon's defeat and downfall, French nationalism from the 19th to early 20th century took on an an assertive and extreme patriotism that supported military force to achieve its political goals.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} During [[World War I]] France pursued [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the region of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] that had been lost by France to [[Germany]] at the end of the [[Franco-German War]] of 1870-1871.

The [[war hero]] of [[Free France]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] became [[President of France]] and sought to ressurect national pride.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} De Gaulle sought to make France the leader of an independent Europe - free from American and Soviet influence.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=172}} De Gaulle's government sought Franco-German reconciliation and took a leading role in the founding of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that  sought to resolve economic tensions between France and Germany, that French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] declared was designed &quot;to end Franco-German hostility once and for all.&quot;.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=172}}

Horse breeding in France
</title>

<text>
'''Horse breeding in France''' is a known practice since Celtic times. Linked to political prestige, military effectiveness and the need to obtain animals from daily work, he passes from the hands of wealthy lords and monasteries in the Middle Ages to those of French kings, through the National Stud created by [[Louis XIV]] and [[Colbert]] to control the private breeding. Its history is closely related to human activities and needs of each era with the emergence or disappearance of specific types of horses (horses for war, work, carriage, draft, racing, sport...) according to the uses and needs. The [[cavalry]] and transport for people or materials, in particular, are the two main motivations for this. If the reputation of the French working horses, and especially the [[Percheron]], is known all around the world, the military riding horse is poor. The organization of the breeding and the creation of studbooks only dates from the late nineteenth century.The [[engine]] and the progress of [[agriculture]] are largely backward farming in the twentieth century. Inducing techniques with the end of military and commercial uses of the horse, breeders are now found four main outlets. Especially for horse racing Thoroughbred farms and French trotters, the latter being most common. Some personalities like [[Jean-Pierre Dubois]] are renowned breeders. The sport has revealed some equine athletes [[Selle Fran?ais]] and [[Anglo-Arab]], as [[Jappeloup]]. Recreational riding, or the company, still growing although the number of horses adapted remains reduced, with some local initiatives such as the successful [[Henson (horse)|Henson]]. Finally, meat production breeds (draft horses) almost exclusively deals with the exportation or horses reform. 900,000 horses are recorded in France in 2008. The National Stud disengage gradually tutelage of their long history of private farming, the many reforms in the sector were finally conducted, since 2010, the creation of the Institut fran?ais du cheval et de l'?quitation.

Horse breeding is entirely within the agricultural sector since 2005, it is subject to rules regarding the identification, sale, selection of breeding techniques and monitoring of births. The French government still distributes bonuses for the birth of foals and endangered breeds of livestock competitions or recovery sports for young horses. Ranchers gather themselves into associations, unions and federations to defend and promote their business.
